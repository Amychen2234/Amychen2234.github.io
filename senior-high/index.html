<h1>高中：小城市的停滞、休学和省会的重生 High School: Stagnation in a Small City, Drop Out, and Rebirth in the Capital City of Hunan</h1>

<p>在高中的第一学期期中考试中，我轻松考了全校第一。然而，从外公外婆家到父母身边，再到高中校园的这段迁徙并没有让我感到成就感，反而带来了深深的压抑。成绩的优秀并没有驱散我心中的疑问：“读书的意义究竟是什么？” 当时，这个问题像一道无法解开的谜题，让我开始厌倦枯燥的课业和日复一日的重复生活。我向父母提出休学的想法时，他们起初并不当真，以为这只是青少年的叛逆。然而，当我彻底停止上学，他们才意识到事态的严重性。亲戚们纷纷登门劝说，但没人能给我一个让我信服的答案。学习不是我的抗争，而是对“生活”的抗议。最终，我做了一个当时看来是大胆而绝望的决定：假借一张身份证，去江苏投奔正在沿海工厂打工的姐姐。对于一个来自农村的女孩来说，社会提供的选项少得可怜。我起初在网吧做收银员，后来到服装店卖衣服，最后进入了工厂。这段经历的时间虽然短暂，却让我体会到了从未感受过的深渊。</p>

<p>In the first semester of high school, I easily ranked first in the whole school. However, the transition from my grandparents' house to my parents' and then to high school did not bring me a sense of achievement; instead, it brought a deep sense of oppression. My excellent grades did not dispel the question in my mind: "What is the meaning of studying?" At that time, this question felt like an unsolvable riddle, and I began to grow weary of the dull coursework and the repetitive daily life. When I proposed the idea of dropping out of school to my parents, they initially did not take it seriously, thinking it was just teenage rebellion. However, when I stopped attending school completely, they realized the seriousness of the situation. Relatives came to persuade me, but no one could provide me with an answer that convinced me. Studying was not my struggle, but a protest against "life." In the end, I made a bold and seemingly desperate decision: I borrowed an ID card and went to Jiangsu to join my sister who was working in a coastal factory. For a girl from the countryside, the social options were incredibly limited. I initially worked as a cashier in an internet cafe, then sold clothes in a clothing store, and finally joined the factory. Although the time spent there was brief, it exposed me to a depth I had never felt before.</p>

<p>工厂生活让我第一次近距离接触到“命运”的重量。工作单调而重复，人与人之间疏离而冷漠，整个世界像是一台不知疲倦的机器。在流水线上，一分一秒都被拉长成永恒，我感到自己的未来仿佛被锁在这片拥挤又无望的工厂里。我甚至搭过陌生人的车，也遭遇过男性的骚扰。生活的恐惧感在压迫中迅速蔓延。更让我痛苦的是，家庭的支持也变得遥不可及。与姐姐住在一起的日子时常充满冲突，她无法理解我沉默中的抗议，甚至用拳脚回应我的不服从。在这个陌生的城市里，我没有安全感，更没有归属感。那段时间，我常常在黑暗中发问：如果努力只是换来这样的生活，那努力的意义又在哪里？这种反思推动了我的第二个决定：回家，重新开始。</p>

<p>Factory life brought me face to face with the weight of "fate" for the first time. The work was monotonous and repetitive, and the people were distant and cold; the whole world felt like a tireless machine. On the assembly line, every minute and second felt stretched into eternity, and I felt as though my future was locked in this crowded and hopeless factory. I even hitchhiked with strangers and experienced male harassment. The sense of fear in life spread quickly in the oppression. What made it even more painful was that family support had become distant and unreachable. Living with my sister was often filled with conflict, as she couldn’t understand my silent protest, even responding to my disobedience with physical force. In this unfamiliar city, I had no sense of security and no sense of belonging. During that time, I often asked myself in the darkness: if effort only leads to this kind of life, then what is the meaning of effort? This reflection led to my second decision: to go back home and start over.</p>

<p>回到家后，得益于我之前优异的成绩，家里亲戚为我争取到了乡下一所当地高中的全额奖学金，我得以再次进入高中。最初的一切都显得那么简单，我很快又考到了全校第一。然而，这种轻松与得意也带来了新的问题——我对老师的不满与挑衅变得更加强烈，尤其是化学老师的一次公开羞辱，彻底点燃了我的愤怒。那是我生命中第一次尝试掌控自己的命运，不再逆来顺受。在愤然离校后，我凭借自己的努力寻找转学的机会。一所省会城市的私立学校破例允许我参加入学考试，我的数学与英语成绩让他们印象深刻。在我大胆地向校方争取全额奖学金后，他们意外地同意了我的请求。这一刻，我第一次感受到“争取”带来的力量，也第一次开始相信，自己的声音是可以被听到的。</p>

<p>After returning home, thanks to my previous excellent grades, my relatives helped me secure a full scholarship to a local high school in the countryside, allowing me to return to high school. Everything seemed so simple at first, and I quickly ranked first in the whole school again. However, this ease and pride also brought new problems—my dissatisfaction and provocation towards the teachers grew even stronger, especially after a public humiliation by my chemistry teacher, which completely ignited my anger. That was the first time in my life that I tried to take control of my own fate and no longer passively accepted things. After leaving school angrily, I used my own efforts to find an opportunity to transfer schools. A private school in the provincial capital made an exception and allowed me to take the entrance exam. My math and English grades impressed them. When I boldly requested a full scholarship from the school, they unexpectedly agreed to my request. At that moment, I first felt the power of "fighting for something" and began to believe that my voice could be heard.</p>

<p>新的学校给了我完全不同的体验。因为是私立学校，这里的班级人数较少，学生是湖南各地的择优录取，同学们关系紧密，贫富差距被校服掩盖，几乎不再是被关注的焦点。学校的支持和老师的关怀让我感到久违的温暖，尤其是生物老师的一次贴心询问——她发现我有些不合群，主动问我是否想家。这种温柔的关心让我仿佛又回到了外公外婆的家中。在这里，我交到了许多朋友，许多至今仍是我生命中的挚友。这种平等与接纳让我第一次体会到归属感的力量。但再温暖的校园，面对高考时的竞争压力也会显得严峻。在学校的外教课上，我第一次与外国老师交流。他们的思想深度、表达方式和游历的经验激发了我对更大世界的向往。从那时起，我开始渴望探索世界，甚至希望有一天能够出国留学。我给许多英国和美国的学校写信，倾诉自己的梦想。然而，大部分邮件没有收到任何回复。当我多年后重新读到这些邮件时，心中充满了复杂的情感。那个渴望自由的自己，那些无法寄达的信件，见证了我成长中的挣扎和对更美好生活的追求。</p>

<p>The new school gave me a completely different experience. Because it was a private school, the class sizes were smaller, and the students were selected from all over Hunan, so the relationships between students were tight, and the differences in wealth were covered by school uniforms, making them almost no longer the focus of attention. The support from the school and the care from the teachers gave me a warmth I hadn't felt in a long time, especially after a thoughtful inquiry from my biology teacher—she noticed that I seemed a bit isolated and kindly asked if I missed home. This gentle concern made me feel as if I was back in my grandparents' house. Here, I made many friends, many of whom are still dear to me today. This sense of equality and acceptance allowed me to experience the power of belonging for the first time. But no matter how warm the campus, the competition pressure during the college entrance exam was still intense. During an English class with a foreign teacher, I had my first exchange with foreign teachers. Their depth of thought, manner of expression, and travel experience sparked my longing for a bigger world. From that moment, I began to yearn to explore the world and even hoped that one day I could study abroad. I wrote letters to many schools in the UK and the US, sharing my dreams. However, most of the letters never received a response. When I read those letters again many years later, my heart was filled with complex emotions. The version of me who longed for freedom, those undelivered letters, witnessed my struggles and my pursuit of a better life during my growth.</p>

<p>高中阶段，我经历了自我意识的觉醒，也感受到系统对个体的冷漠。从工厂的绝望，到学校的温暖，这段旅程让我明白了一件事：归属感是需要自己创造的。只有通过挣扎与抗争，我才可能掌控自己的命运。这段经历不仅是我个人的故事，也是那个时代中国社会剧烈变化的缩影。城市化、教育改革、农村与城市的巨大落差，都影响着我的成长轨迹。在对抗中，我找到了自己的声音；在流动中，我学会了与世界对话；在孤独中，我逐渐学会了与自己和解。</p>

<p>During high school, I experienced the awakening of self-awareness and also felt the system’s indifference to the individual. From the despair in the factory to the warmth at school, this journey taught me one thing: belonging is something you must create for yourself. Only through struggle and resistance can I truly take control of my own destiny. This experience is not only my personal story but also a microcosm of the dramatic changes in Chinese society during that era. Urbanization, educational reform, and the vast disparity between rural and urban areas all influenced my path of growth. Through resistance, I found my voice; through movement, I learned to communicate with the world; through loneliness, I gradually learned to reconcile with myself.</p>
