    <h2>Background</h2>
    <ul>
    <p>This is a gift from my previous boss who guided me to write with brivity and articulate my thoughts. I struggled a bit due to my inability to focus but found the training tremendously helpful - I aspire to continuously work on myself to write with clarity. </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chaoter 1: Change your Perspective</h2>
    <ul> 
      <P>Interest takeaways: 1) Clarity can be dangerous because people who read what you wrote might disagree with it. 2) To stand out, it is a matter of connecting with your own natural ways of communicating. 3)Treat the reader's time as more valuable than your own. 4) Each small step toward expediency erodes your own sense of integrity 5)Take this principle to heart: net it out in 3 clear points.
        
      </P>
