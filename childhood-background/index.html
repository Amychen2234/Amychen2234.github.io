  <h1>时代背景：改革开放的黄金浪潮与农村的静默</h1>
  <h1>Context: The Golden Wave of China's Reform and the Silence of Rural China</h1>

<p>1992年春天，邓小平南巡的步伐掀起了中国经济发展的狂潮。这次巡访与随后的讲话被视为改革开放的转折点，为中国经济注入了新的活力。从沿海城市到经济特区，从深圳到珠三角，南巡讲话犹如点燃的火炬，照亮了改革的前路。外资涌入，市场经济的风帆高扬，东南沿海地区迎来了中国现代化进程中最具活力的时代。然而，在这股狂热浪潮之外，中西部的农村却似乎停滞在另一个时间轴上，仿佛静默的稻田，只能遥望彼岸的灯火。</p>
<p>In the spring of 1992, Deng Xiaoping's southern tour ignited a frenzy of economic development in China. This tour and the subsequent speeches are regarded as a turning point in the reform and opening-up process, injecting new vitality into China's economy. From coastal cities to economic zones, from Shenzhen to the Pearl River Delta, the southern tour speech was like a lit torch, illuminating the path of reform. Foreign investment poured in, and the sails of the market economy rose high, bringing the southeastern coastal region into the most vibrant period of China’s modernization. However, outside this frenzied wave, the rural areas in the central and western regions seemed to stagnate on another timeline, like silent rice fields, only able to gaze at the lights across the shore.</p>

<p>邓小平南巡之后，中国的GDP增速迅猛攀升，1992年全年经济增长率高达14.2%。沿海城市如深圳、上海迅速崛起为国际化都市，出口贸易和外商投资成为驱动经济的引擎。1993年，中国吸引了270亿美元的外资，仅深圳一地的工业产值增长便超过50%。然而，与沿海地区的繁荣相对，中西部的农村仍被经济改革的大潮所边缘化。土地依旧是农民的主要经济依托，农业收入占家庭总收入的80%以上。缺乏工业化和基础设施的农村，在快速发展的经济画卷中，像一片未被涂抹的空白。</p>
<p>After Deng Xiaoping’s southern tour, China’s GDP growth rate soared, reaching 14.2% in 1992. Coastal cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai quickly rose to become international metropolises, with export trade and foreign investment driving the economy. In 1993, China attracted $27 billion in foreign investment, and in Shenzhen alone, industrial output grew by over 50%. However, in stark contrast to the prosperity of the coastal areas, the rural areas in the central and western regions remained marginalized by the wave of economic reform. Land remained the primary economic reliance of farmers, with agricultural income accounting for over 80% of household income. Lacking industrialization and infrastructure, the rural areas appeared as blank spaces in the rapidly developing economic landscape.</p>

<p>这种区域间的经济鸿沟，犹如第一次和第二次工业革命的全球影响。当英国在18世纪掀起工业革命时，工业化迅速蔓延到欧洲和北美的贸易伙伴，塑造了现代发达国家。然而，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲许多国家未能被工业化的涟漪波及，依旧深陷贫困。20世纪90年代的中国，同样在经历着内部发展的不均衡——沿海地区迅速迈向现代化，而内陆农村则仍然挣扎在传统农业经济的循环中。</p>
<p>This regional economic divide is similar to the global effects of the first and second industrial revolutions. When Britain launched the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, industrialization quickly spread to Europe and North America’s trade partners, shaping modern developed countries. However, many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were not touched by the ripples of industrialization and remained trapped in poverty. In the 1990s, China also experienced internal development inequality — coastal areas rapidly moved towards modernization, while the inland rural areas struggled within the traditional agricultural economy.</p>

<p>在这样的背景下，我出生在湖南农村，这片土地远离南巡的喧嚣和改革的荣光。与沿海城市的孩子们涌向新兴学校和产业园不同，我的童年被稻田和家庭的农业生活所环绕。农忙季节，大人们弯腰插秧，而我们这些孩子们则在田埂上嬉闹，偶尔也被拉去帮忙拔草、捡稻穗。农业生产方式简单而传统，主要依靠家庭劳力，机器化几乎为零。</p>
<p>In this context, I was born in rural Hunan, far from the bustling southern tour and the glory of reform. Unlike the children in coastal cities who flocked to emerging schools and industrial parks, my childhood was surrounded by rice fields and the agricultural life of my family. During the busy farming season, adults bent over to plant rice, while we children also were being pulled into helping pull weeds or pick rice grains. The farming methods were simple and traditional, primarily relying on family labor, with almost no mechanization.</p>

<p>然而，农村的劳动并不仅限于田间耕作。成年人的命运在田野中扎根，而孩子们的生活则被另一种隐形的分离定义——父母为求更高的收入被迫外出务工，留下的孩子们成为了“留守儿童”。1992年到1998年，中国的流动人口数量从7000万迅速增长到1.2亿，这意味着近一半的农民工离开了家乡，奔赴沿海地区寻找机会。这一浪潮在城市繁荣的背后，制造了无数个分离的家庭，也让农村的童年蒙上了孤独的阴影。统计数据显示，1995年，农村地区的留守儿童数量已经超过2000万。</p>
<p>However, rural labor was not limited to the fields. Adults' fates were rooted in the land, while children's lives were defined by another form of invisible separation — parents were motivated to leave home for higher incomes in the cities, and the children left behind became "left-behind children." From 1992 to 1998, China's migrant population grew rapidly from 70 million to 120 million, meaning nearly half of the rural migrant workers left their hometowns to seek opportunities in coastal areas. This wave, behind the prosperity of the cities, created countless separated families and cast a shadow of loneliness over rural childhoods. Statistics show that by 1995, the number of left-behind children in rural areas had exceeded 20 million.</p>

<p>我就是这些留守儿童中的一员。虽然父母并没有离家太远。但每次离别，我都在村口哭得声嘶力竭，却无法阻止这场分别的循环。在那些年，我的主要陪伴来自外公外婆。他们用无声却厚重的爱为我遮挡了许多成长的寒冷，但无论如何，这种爱的形式始终带着一种无奈。田间的稻浪起伏，正如农村孩子和城市孩子之间的命运鸿沟，始终无声而深刻。</p>
<p>I was one of these left-behind children. From the time I could remember, each time they left, I cried hoarsely at the village, unable to stop the cycle of separation. During those years, my main companions were my grandfather and grandmother. They sheltered me with their silent but heavy love, protecting me from much of the coldness of growing up, but no matter how, this form of love always carried a sense of helplessness. The rice waves in the fields are like the fate gap between rural and urban children, always silent and profound.</p>

<p>在这样的农村生活中，性别的角色分化异常鲜明，重男轻女的观念仍然根深蒂固。尽管90年代初期，《中华人民共和国义务教育法》的实施让更多农村孩子进入了学校，但女孩的教育权利依旧容易在家庭经济压力下被牺牲。许多家庭将资源优先倾向于男孩，女孩则被要求早早辍学，帮助家里务农或在婚后成为他人的妻子。</p>
<p>In rural life, gender roles were starkly divided, with the concept of valuing sons over daughters still deeply entrenched. Although the implementation of the "Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China" in the early 1990s allowed more rural children to attend school, girls' educational rights were still easily sacrificed under family economic pressure. Many families prioritized resources for boys, and girls were required to drop out of school early to help with farming or become someone else's wife after marriage.</p>

<p>尽管中西部农村在改革开放的浪潮中未能直接受益，但这一时期也为未来的改变埋下了种子。农业税负开始逐渐减轻，农村教育投入逐步增加，90年代末期电视和电力的普及，让农村的生活逐渐被现代化的元素所渗透。与此同时，外出务工带回的不仅是金钱，还有城市化的观念和眼界。这种变化在90年代末并不显著，却为21世纪农村的脱贫与发展奠定了基础。</p>
<p>Although the rural areas in the central and western regions did not directly benefit from the reform and opening-up waves, this period also planted the seeds for future change. The agricultural tax burden began to gradually decrease, rural education investment steadily increased, and by the late 1990s, the popularization of television and electricity allowed modern elements to slowly penetrate rural life. Meanwhile, the money brought back by migrant workers also carried urbanization concepts and broadened horizons. This change was not significant in the late 1990s, but it laid the foundation for rural poverty alleviation and development in the 21st century.</p>

<p>然而，在那个以农业为主的年代，改革的成果依旧难以被大多数农村人触及。1998年，中国的农业劳动力仍占总劳动力的70%以上，农村人均年收入仅为沿海城市的五分之一。教育的普及率有所提高，但许多农村学校的条件依旧简陋，师资力量不足，女孩的辍学率仍居高不下。</p>
<p>However, in those agricultural-dominant years, the fruits of reform were still difficult for most rural people to touch. In 1998, agricultural labor still accounted for over 70% of the total labor force, and rural per capita income was only one-fifth of that in coastal cities. Although the education rate had improved, many rural schools were still in poor condition, with insufficient teaching staff, and the dropout rate for girls remained high.</p>

<p>站在今天的纽约，我经常反思这段特殊的成长经历。从邓小平南巡到改革开放的高歌猛进，我看到两个中国的并存：一个是崛起的城市中国，一个是缓慢变革的农村中国。我生于稻田间的土地，成长于改革的边缘，却最终跨越了这条界线。这种跨越既是幸运，也是一种责任。我常常思考，那些被留在稻田里的孩子，那些未能走出村庄的女孩，她们的命运会不会随着更多政策的倾斜而改变？</p>
<p>Today, standing in New York, I often reflect on this special growth experience. From Deng Xiaoping's southern tour to the soaring progress of reform, I see the coexistence of two Chinas: one is the rising urban China, and the other is the slowly transforming rural China. I was born in the land of rice fields, grew up on the margins of reform, but ultimately crossed this boundary. This leap is both a blessing and a responsibility. I often think about the children left in the rice fields, the girls who never left the village. Will their fate change with more policy shifts?</p>

<p>92-98年是中国现代化进程的起点，是塑造未来中国的黄金时代。而我的童年，是这一时代背景的缩影，也是农耕社会与工业社会之间的过渡体。我从未忘记稻田间的炊烟，也不会忘记那片土地的沉默。农村的故事，依然在现代化的浪潮中等待被倾听，而我，愿意成为那个讲述故事的人。</p>
<p>The period from 1992 to 1998 was the starting point of China’s modernization process, the golden age that shaped the future of China. My childhood was a microcosm of this era, also a transitional body between an agricultural society and an industrial society. I will never forget the smoke rising from the rice fields, nor will I forget the silence of that land. The story of rural China still awaits to be heard in the wave of modernization, and I am willing to be the one who tells that story.</p>
