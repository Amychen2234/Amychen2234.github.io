  <h1>Childhood: Growing Up in Rural Hunan During Reform-Era China | 童年 (1992-1998)：湖南农村的成长 </h1>

  <p>在32岁的今天，我站在纽约的公寓窗前，俯瞰这座不夜城。高楼、霓虹、车水马龙，这些象征着繁华与成功的景象却常常令我的思绪回到那片田野——湖南乡间的稻田、鸭群嬉戏的池塘、外婆锅巴粥的香气，还有炊烟袅袅的村庄。站在这个都市中心，我忍不住问自己：田野里的女孩，如何穿越无形的镣铐来到这里？为什么她成为了例外，而其他女孩却扎根农家的土地上？是天赋，是努力，还是一种制度化的不公？而这一路，究竟是祝福，还是诅咒？</p>
<p>At the age of 32 years, I stand by the window of my apartment in New York, overlooking this sleepless city. The skyscrapers, neon lights, and bustling traffic, symbols of prosperity and success, often make my thoughts drift back to the fields — the rice paddies of rural Hunan, the ducks frolicking in the ponds, the aroma of my grandmother's crispy rice porridge, and the smoke rising from the village. Standing in the heart of this urban center, I can’t help but ask myself: How did the girl from the rice fields break through these invisible barriers to get here? Why is she the exception, while other girls remain stuck in the village? Is it talent, effort, or a kind of institutionalized injustice? And along the way, has this been a blessing or a curse?</p>
    
  <p>1992年，我出生在计划生育政策最严苛的年代。对于当时的农村家庭，“生儿子”是一场关系到尊严与未来的赌博，而母亲的地位几乎与生育能力绑定在一起。我的出生是幸运的——姐姐和我是“允许”的两个女儿。但当我弟弟出生时，家庭被罚了8000元巨款，这些钱不仅榨干了家里的一切，也成为了弟弟的绰号——“陈八千”。我的生日，农历七月初二，原本是属于自己的特殊日子，却总是伴随着一种情感的隐痛。父母忙碌的生计常常忘记我的生日，而有一年，我用攒下的20块零花钱买了一个蛋糕，却因“浪费钱”被母亲责骂到泪流满面。</p>
<p>In 1992, I was born during the strictest years of the one-child policy. For rural families at the time, "having a son" was a gamble that provided dignity and future for a family, and a mother's status was almost entirely bound to her ability to have a boy. My birth was lucky — my sister and I were the "allowed" two daughters in rural areas. But when my younger brother was born, my family was fined 8,000 yuan, a sum that drained all our resources and became his nickname — "Eight Thousand Chen." My birthday, the second day of the seventh lunar month, was supposed to be a special day for me, but it was always accompanied by a quiet emotional pain. My parents, busy with their livelihood, often forgot my birthday, and one year, I bought a cake with my saved-up 20 yuan, only to be scolded by my mother for "wasting money" until I cried. As time went on, my birthday became a day I preferred to spend in solitude, with solo trips and quiet personal celebrations.</p>

  <p>如果说这段“被忽视感”在我心中种下了一颗种子，那么外公外婆的爱，则让这颗种子得以生根发芽。虽然我作为留守儿童被寄养在外公外婆家，即使物质匮乏，但他们用无声的爱为我撑起了一片晴空。外公是一个沉默却坚定的人。他喜欢跟我一起看新闻联播，也热衷给我讲抗日战争的故事。他常提起的一句话是“砍头不要紧，只要主义真。”虽然那时的我不完全明白它的含义，但这句话成为了我内心的支柱，它让我知道：做人要有骨气，不能轻易屈服于外界的压力。外婆是另一个世界的象征，她的爱藏在每一个琐碎却温暖的细节里。她会把零食藏在米缸里，等我放学回家后悄悄递给我；冬天，她会用棉被把我裹得严严实实；她煮的锅巴粥，是我至今挥之不去的味觉记忆。那个简陋的小茅房，没有自来水，没有厕所，却是我一生情感最安全的地方。</p>
<p>If this feeling of "being emotionally overlooked" planted a seed in my heart, the love from my grandfather and grandmother allowed that seed to take root and grow. Although I was raised by my grandparents as a left-behind child, living in material scarcity, they supported me with silent love. My grandfather was a quiet but determined man. He liked to watch the CCTV news with me and loved to tell me stories about the Sino-Japan war. One phrase he often mentioned was, "Beheading does not matter as long as you stay true to your principles." Although I didn’t fully understand it at the time, this phrase became the pillar of my guiding principle. It taught me to have integrity and not to easily succumb to external pressures. My grandmother symbolized another world; her love was hidden in every trivial yet warm detail. She would hide snacks in the rice jar and secretly give them to me after school; in the winter, she would wrap me tightly in blankets. The crispy rice porridge she made is a taste memory I will never forget. That simple little hut, with no running water or toilet, was the safest place I have ever lived.</p>

  <p>村里的女孩们并没有我这样的幸运。她们的命运像田野里未成熟的稻穗，在一场名为“文化与贫困”的风暴中被无情割下。她们被教导，“生个女儿不如养头猪”“嫁出去的女儿如泼出去的水”。大多数女孩早早辍学，为弟弟让路，或者在青春尚未开始时嫁做人妇。她们的名字在世上没有重量，像稻壳一样被风吹散。而我的命运却因成绩和性格被无形中豁免了，我从未被要求放弃学业，从未被灌输“你不配”的思想。</p>
<p>The girls in the village were not as fortunate as I was. Their fates were like the immature rice grains in the fields, mercilessly cut down in a storm called "culture and poverty." They were taught, "Having a daughter is no better than raising a pig" and "A married daughter is like water poured out." Most girls dropped out of school early to make way for their brothers or married before their youth even began. Their names held no weight in the world, like rice husks blown away by the wind. My fate, however, was exempt from these expectations because of my academic performance and character that pandered to my family and neighbors. I was never asked to give up my studies, never taught the lesson that "you don't deserve it."</p>

  <p>小时候的我成绩优异，性格乖巧懂事，总是被长辈称为“别人家的孩子”。外公会骄傲地竖起大拇指，邻里间也会拿我的成绩炫耀：“你们家这个丫头，将来肯定有出息。” 这样的认可让我相信自己是重要的，是被需要的。因为我聪明，我是家族未来的投资；因为我礼貌，我赢得了大人们的偏爱。但这种“例外”让我意识到命运规则的随机性和不公正。为什么我是幸运的？为什么我的命运可以与其他女孩不同？这种意识让我变得敏锐，也让我从小对规则产生叛逆的冲动。我知道规则不公平，我知道规则可以被挑战，但我也知道，天赋和运气是我挑战规则的资本，而它们并不属于所有人。</p>
<p>As a child, I was an excellent student, obedient and well-behaved, often called "the role model of all other children." My grandfather would proudly give me a thumbs-up, and the neighbors would boast about my grades: "This girl from your family will definitely have a bright future." This kind of recognition made me believe that I was important, that I was needed. Because I was smart, my family saw prosperity I could bring to them in my future; because I was polite and kind to others, I won the favor of adults. But this "exception" made me realize the randomness and injustice of fate. Why was I lucky? Why was my fate different from that of other girls? This awareness made me more sensitive and, from a young age, I became rebellious against rules. I knew the rules were unfair, I knew they could be challenged, but I also knew that talent and luck were the capital that allowed me to challenge the rules, and they were not afforded to everyone.</p>

  <p>童年的阳光给了我一生的保护伞。外公外婆的爱，老师和村人的称赞，构成了我性格底色的光亮：相信世界是善意的，相信努力会有回报，相信自己值得拥有更多。但它也留下了裂缝。我从小习惯通过外界的认可定义自己的价值，这种对认可的依赖像一把双刃剑，驱动我不断努力，却也让我成年后在关系和自我价值中陷入迷茫。外公外婆的爱是无声的，它教会了我感受和接受，却没有教会我表达。长大后，我发现自己总是过于敏感、过于回避麻烦。我害怕提需求，害怕被拒绝，害怕因为不够“懂事”而失去他人的喜欢和认可。这种恐惧让我在人际关系中显得格外克制，总是压抑自己的情感需求，用“懂事”掩盖内心的脆弱。</p>
<p>The brightness of my childhood gave me a protective umbrella throughout my adult life. The love of my grandparents, the praise from my teachers and neighbors, formed the brightness of my character: believing that the world is kind, believing that effort will be rewarded, and believing that I deserve more. But it also left cracks. From a young age, I learned to define my value through external recognition. This dependence on approval was like a double-edged sword, driving me to work hard, but also causing me to fall into confusion in relationships with others and self-worth as an adult. My grandparents’ love was silent; it taught me that love can be rewarded through well-behaved attitude, but did not teach me how to express my authentic self and my inner voice. As I grew older, I realized that I was overly sensitive, overly avoiding confrontation. I feared asking for what I needed, feared rejection, and feared losing others’ favor for not being “well-behaved.” This fear made me unusually restrained in interpersonal relationships, always suppressing my emotional needs and hiding my inner fragility behind the façade of "being understanding."</p>

  <p>童年的田野让我感受到自由，而纽约却让我重新认识到规则的禁锢。田野让我学会观察，学会与自然和谐共处，也让我在辽阔的天地中找到内心的平静。但乡村的文化却总让我感到格格不入。那些长辈们一边夸我聪明，一边对其他女孩的命运嗤之以鼻；一边对我的成绩赞不绝口，一边告诉我“女孩子别太出头”。这样的矛盾让我早早意识到，规则是一场骗局，而打破规则的唯一办法，是靠自己的努力与坚持。</p>
<p>The village fields of my childhood gave me a sense of freedom, but New York made me reawaken to the constraints of rules. The fields taught me how to observe, how to live in harmony with nature, and helped me find inner peace in vast surroundings. But rural culture always made me feel out of place. The elders would praise my intelligence while disparaging the fate of other girls who were not as talented as I was; they would speak highly of my academic achievements but would tell girls, “Don’t stand out too much as a girl.” This contradiction made me realize early on that rules are a sham, and you can break them if you gained competitive advantage.</p>

  <p>在纽约，我常常想起外婆煮的锅巴粥，想起外公的讲故事声，想起那些炊烟和稻田的气味。它们提醒我，无论走多远，田野都刻在我的血液里。但我也知道，我与田野的距离，无法仅靠思念来弥合。童年的光亮让我敢于追求远方，但它也让我背负着一种挥之不去的责任感：如何为那些被割断的稻穗发声？如何证明我的幸运不是偶然，而是某种必须被承认的不公？</p>
<p>In New York, I often think of the crispy rice porridge my grandmother made, I think of my grandfather’s storytelling, I think of the smell of the smoke and rice paddies. They remind me that, no matter how far I go, the fields are etched in my blood. But I also know that the distance between me and the fields cannot be bridged by mere longing. The light of my childhood offered me courage to pursue faraway places, but it also burdened me with an inescapable sense of responsibility: How can I give a voice to those "cut-off rice grain" girls? How can I prove that my luck is not accidental, but a kind of injustice that must be acknowledged?</p>

  <p>今天的我，站在纽约高楼上，与田野里的小女孩对话。她曾经奔跑在泥泞的小路上，以为世界是阳光的、单纯的；而现在的我，却知道世界远比田野更复杂、更残酷。我感激她的天真，也理解她的不安。我明白，她的幸运和她的阴影，成就了今天的我。而今天的我，依然在寻找一种平衡，一种让田野的自由与城市的规则共存的方式。我知道，我不是那个被规则困住的女孩，也不是那个完全打破规则的人。但我可以尝试，去创造属于自己的规则，让田野的阳光，照亮更多的稻穗。</p>
<p>Today, I stand in a skyscraper in New York, talking to the little girl in the fields. She once ran along the muddy roads, thinking the world was sunny and simple; now, I know that the world is far more complicated and cruel than the fields. I am grateful for her innocence and also understand her unease. I realize that her luck and her shadow made me who I am today. And today, I am still looking for a balance, a way to let the freedom of the fields and the brutal jungle rules of the city coexist. I know I am not the girl trapped by the rules, nor am I the one who completely breaks the rules. But I can try to create my own rules, letting the sunlight of the fields shine on more "rice grain" girls.</p>
