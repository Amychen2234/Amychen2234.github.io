  <h1>Childhood: Growing Up in Rural Hunan During Reform-Era China | 童年 (1992-1998)：湖南农村的成长 | 邓小平南巡与改革深化</h1>

  <p>在32岁的今天，我站在纽约的公寓窗前，俯瞰这座不夜城。高楼、霓虹、车水马龙，这些象征着繁华与成功的景象却常常令我的思绪回到那片田野——湖南乡间的稻田、鸭群嬉戏的池塘、外婆锅巴粥的香气，还有炊烟袅袅的村庄。站在这个都市中心，我忍不住问自己：田野里的女孩，如何穿越无形的镣铐来到这里？为什么她成为了例外，而其他女孩却永远停留在泥泞里？是天赋，是努力，还是一种制度化的不公？而这一路，究竟是祝福，还是诅咒？</p>
<p>At 32 years old today, I stand by the window of my apartment in New York, overlooking this sleepless city. The skyscrapers, neon lights, and bustling traffic, symbols of prosperity and success, often make my thoughts drift back to the fields — the rice paddies of rural Hunan, the ducks frolicking in the ponds, the aroma of my grandmother's crispy rice porridge, and the smoke rising from the village. Standing in the heart of this urban center, I can’t help but ask myself: How did the girl from the rice fields break through these invisible shackles to get here? Why is she the exception, while other girls remain stuck in the village? Is it talent, effort, or a kind of institutionalized injustice? And along the way, has this been a blessing or a curse?</p>
  <p>1992年，我出生在计划生育政策最严苛的年代。对于当时的农村家庭，“生儿子”是一场关系到尊严与未来的赌博，而母亲的地位几乎与生育能力绑定在一起。我的出生是幸运的——姐姐和我是“允许”的两个女儿。但当我弟弟出生时，家庭被罚了8000元巨款，这些钱不仅榨干了家里的一切，也成为了弟弟的绰号——“陈八千”。我的生日，农历七月初二，原本是属于自己的特殊日子，却总是伴随着一种情感的隐痛。父母忙碌的生计常常忘记我的生日，而有一年，我用攒下的20块零花钱买了一个蛋糕，却因“浪费钱”被母亲责骂到泪流满面。</p>
<p>In 1992, I was born during the strictest years of the one-child policy. For rural families at the time, "having a son" was a gamble that provided dignity and future, and a mother's status was almost entirely bound to her ability to have a boy. My birth was lucky — my sister and I were the "allowed" two daughters. But when my younger brother was born, the family was fined 8,000 yuan, a sum that drained all our resources and became his nickname — "Chen Eight Thousand." My birthday, the second day of the seventh lunar month, was supposed to be a special day just for me, but it was always accompanied by a quiet emotional pain. My parents, busy with their livelihood, often forgot my birthday, and one year, I bought a cake with my saved-up 20 yuan, only to be scolded by my mother for "wasting money" until I cried.</p>

  <p>如果说这段“被忽视感”在我心中种下了一颗种子，那么外公外婆的爱，则让这颗种子得以生根发芽。虽然我作为留守儿童被寄养在外公外婆家，虽然物质匮乏，但他们用无声的爱为我撑起了一片晴空。外公是一个沉默却坚定的人。他喜欢跟我一起看新闻联播，也热衷给我讲抗日战争的故事。他常提起的一句话是“砍头不要紧，只要主义真。”虽然那时的我不完全明白它的含义，但这句话成为了我内心的支柱，它让我知道：做人要有骨气，不能轻易屈服于外界的压力。外婆是另一个世界的象征，她的爱藏在每一个琐碎却温暖的细节里。她会把零食藏在米缸里，等我放学回家后悄悄递给我；冬天，她会用棉被把我裹得严严实实；她煮的锅巴粥，是我至今挥之不去的味觉记忆。那个简陋的小茅房，没有自来水，没有厕所，却是我一生最安全的地方。</p>
<p>If this feeling of "being overlooked" planted a seed in my heart, the love from my grandfather and grandmother allowed that seed to take root and grow. Although I was raised by my grandparents as a left-behind child, living in material scarcity, they supported me with silent love. My grandfather was a quiet but determined man. He liked to watch the CCTV news with me and loved to tell me stories about the War of Resistance against Japan. One phrase he often mentioned was, "It's okay to lose your head as long as your principles are true." Although I didn’t fully understand it at the time, this phrase became the pillar of my heart. It taught me to have integrity and not to easily succumb to external pressures. My grandmother symbolized another world; her love was hidden in every trivial yet warm detail. She would hide snacks in the rice jar and secretly give them to me after school; in the winter, she would wrap me tightly in blankets. The crispy rice porridge she made is a taste memory I will never forget. That simple little hut, with no running water or toilet, was the safest place I have ever known.</p>

  <p>村里的女孩们并没有我这样的幸运。她们的命运像田野里未成熟的稻穗，在一场名为“文化与贫困”的风暴中被无情割下。她们被教导，“生个女儿不如养头猪”“嫁出去的女儿如泼出去的水”。大多数女孩早早辍学，为弟弟让路，或者在青春尚未开始时嫁做人妇。她们的名字在世上没有重量，像稻壳一样被风吹散。而我的命运却因成绩和性格被无形中豁免了，我从未被要求放弃学业，从未被灌输“你不配”的思想。</p>
<p>The girls in the village were not as fortunate as I was. Their fates were like the immature rice grains in the fields, mercilessly cut down in a storm called "culture and poverty." They were taught, "Having a daughter is no better than raising a pig" and "A married daughter is like water poured out." Most girls dropped out of school early to make way for their brothers or married before their youth even began. Their names held no weight in the world, like rice husks blown away by the wind. My fate, however, was exempt from these expectations because of my academic performance and character. I was never asked to abandon my studies, never taught the lesson that "you don't deserve it."</p>

  <p>小时候的我成绩优异，性格乖巧懂事，总是被长辈称为“别人家的孩子”。外公会骄傲地竖起大拇指，邻里间也会拿我的成绩炫耀：“你们家这个丫头，将来肯定有出息。” 这样的认可让我相信自己是重要的，是被需要的。因为我聪明，我是家族未来的投资；因为我礼貌，我赢得了大人们的偏爱。但这种“例外”让我意识到命运规则的随机性和不公正。为什么我是幸运的？为什么我的命运可以与其他女孩不同？这种意识让我变得敏锐，也让我从小对规则产生叛逆的冲动。我知道规则不公平，我知道规则可以被挑战，但我也知道，天赋和运气是我挑战规则的资本，而它们并不属于所有人。</p>
<p>As a child, I was an excellent student, obedient and well-behaved, often called "the role model of all other children." My grandfather would proudly give me a thumbs-up, and the neighbors would boast about my grades: "This girl from your family will definitely have a bright future." This kind of recognition made me believe that I was important, that I was needed. Because I was smart, I was seen as the family's future investment; because I was polite and kind to others, I won the favor of adults. But this "exception" made me realize the randomness and injustice of fate. Why was I lucky? Why was my fate different from that of other girls? This awareness made me more sensitive and, from a young age, I became rebellious against rules. I knew the rules were unfair, I knew they could be challenged, but I also knew that talent and luck were the capital that allowed me to challenge the rules, and they were not afforded to everyone.</p>

  <p>童年的阳光给了我一生的保护伞。外公外婆的爱，老师和村人的称赞，构成了我性格底色的光亮：相信世界是善意的，相信努力会有回报，相信自己值得拥有更多。但它也留下了裂缝。我从小习惯通过外界的认可定义自己的价值，这种对认可的依赖像一把双刃剑，驱动我不断努力，却也让我成年后在关系和自我价值中陷入迷茫。外公外婆的爱是无声的，它教会了我感受和接受，却没有教会我表达。长大后，我发现自己总是过于敏感、过于回避麻烦。我害怕提需求，害怕被拒绝，害怕因为不够“懂事”而失去他人的喜欢。这种恐惧让我在人际关系中显得格外克制，总是压抑自己的情感需求，用“懂事”掩盖内心的脆弱。</p>
<p>The brightness of my childhood gave me a protective umbrella throughout my adult life. The love of my grandparents, the praise from my teachers and neighbors, formed the brightness of my character: believing that the world is kind, believing that effort will be rewarded, and believing that I deserve more. But it also left cracks. From a young age, I learned to define my value through external recognition. This dependence on approval was like a double-edged sword, driving me to work hard, but also causing me to fall into confusion in relationships and self-worth as an adult. My grandparents’ love was silent; it taught me how to accept love through well-behaved attitude, but did not teach me how to express. As I grew older, I realized that I was overly sensitive, overly avoiding confrontation. I feared asking for what I needed, feared rejection, and feared losing others’ favor for not being “well-behaved.” This fear made me unusually restrained in interpersonal relationships, always suppressing my emotional needs and hiding my inner fragility behind the façade of "being understanding."</p>

  <p>童年的田野让我感受到自由，而纽约却让我重新认识到规则的禁锢。田野让我学会观察，学会与自然和谐共处，也让我在辽阔的天地中找到内心的平静。但乡村的文化却总让我感到格格不入。那些长辈们一边夸我聪明，一边对其他女孩的命运嗤之以鼻；一边对我的成绩赞不绝口，一边告诉我“女孩子别太出头”。这样的矛盾让我早早意识到，规则是一场骗局，而打破规则的唯一办法，是靠自己的努力与坚持。</p>
<p>The village fields of my childhood gave me a sense of freedom, but New York made me reawaken to the constraints of rules. The fields taught me how to observe, how to live in harmony with nature, and helped me find inner peace in vast surroundings. But rural culture always made me feel out of place. The elders would praise my intelligence while disparaging the fate of other girls; they would speak highly of my academic achievements but would tell girls, “Don’t stand out too much as a girl.” This contradiction made me realize early on that rules are a sham, and you can break them through one’s own effort and persistence.</p>

  <p>在纽约，我常常想起外婆煮的锅巴粥，想起外公的讲故事声，想起那些炊烟和稻田的气味。它们提醒我，无论走多远，田野都刻在我的血液里。但我也知道，我与田野的距离，无法仅靠思念来弥合。童年的光亮让我敢于追求远方，但它也让我背负着一种挥之不去的责任感：如何为那些被割断的稻穗发声？如何证明我的幸运不是偶然，而是某种必须被承认的不公？</p>
<p>In New York, I often think of the crispy rice porridge my grandmother made, I think of my grandfather’s storytelling, I think of the smell of the smoke and rice paddies. They remind me that, no matter how far I go, the fields are etched in my blood. But I also know that the distance between me and the fields cannot be bridged by mere longing. The light of my childhood made me dare to pursue faraway places, but it also burdened me with an inescapable sense of responsibility: How can I give a voice to those "cut-off rice grains"? How can I prove that my luck is not accidental, but a kind of injustice that must be acknowledged?</p>

  <p>今天的我，站在纽约高楼上，与田野里的小女孩对话。她曾经奔跑在泥泞的小路上，以为世界是阳光的、单纯的；而现在的我，却知道世界远比田野更复杂、更残酷。我感激她的天真，也理解她的不安。我明白，她的幸运和她的阴影，成就了今天的我。而今天的我，依然在寻找一种平衡，一种让田野的自由与城市的规则共存的方式。我知道，我不是那个被规则困住的女孩，也不是那个完全打破规则的人。但我可以尝试，去创造属于自己的规则，让田野的阳光，照亮更多的稻穗。</p>
<p>Today, I stand in a skyscraper in New York, talking to the little girl in the fields. She once ran along the muddy roads, thinking the world was sunny and simple; now, I know that the world is far more complicated and cruel than the fields. I am grateful for her innocence and also understand her unease. I realize that her luck and her shadow made me who I am today. And today, I am still looking for a balance, a way to let the freedom of the fields and the rules of the city coexist. I know I am not the girl trapped by the rules, nor am I the one who completely breaks the rules. But I can try to create my own rules, letting the sunlight of the fields shine on more "rice grains".</p>

  <h1>时代背景：改革开放的黄金浪潮与农村的静默</h1>
  <h1>Context: The Golden Wave of China's Reform and the Silence of Rural China</h1>

<p>1992年春天，邓小平南巡的步伐掀起了中国经济发展的狂潮。这次巡访与随后的讲话被视为改革开放的转折点，为中国经济注入了新的活力。从沿海城市到经济特区，从深圳到珠三角，南巡讲话犹如点燃的火炬，照亮了改革的前路。外资涌入，市场经济的风帆高扬，东南沿海地区迎来了中国现代化进程中最具活力的时代。然而，在这股狂热浪潮之外，中西部的农村却似乎停滞在另一个时间轴上，仿佛静默的稻田，只能遥望彼岸的灯火。</p>
<p>In the spring of 1992, Deng Xiaoping's southern tour ignited a frenzy of economic development in China. This tour and the subsequent speeches are regarded as a turning point in the reform and opening-up process, injecting new vitality into China's economy. From coastal cities to economic zones, from Shenzhen to the Pearl River Delta, the southern tour speech was like a lit torch, illuminating the path of reform. Foreign investment poured in, and the sails of the market economy rose high, bringing the southeastern coastal region into the most vibrant period of China’s modernization. However, outside this frenzied wave, the rural areas in the central and western regions seemed to stagnate on another timeline, like silent rice fields, only able to gaze at the lights across the shore.</p>

<p>邓小平南巡之后，中国的GDP增速迅猛攀升，1992年全年经济增长率高达14.2%。沿海城市如深圳、上海迅速崛起为国际化都市，出口贸易和外商投资成为驱动经济的引擎。1993年，中国吸引了270亿美元的外资，仅深圳一地的工业产值增长便超过50%。然而，与沿海地区的繁荣相对，中西部的农村仍被经济改革的大潮所边缘化。土地依旧是农民的主要经济依托，农业收入占家庭总收入的80%以上。缺乏工业化和基础设施的农村，在快速发展的经济画卷中，像一片未被涂抹的空白。</p>
<p>After Deng Xiaoping’s southern tour, China’s GDP growth rate soared, reaching 14.2% in 1992. Coastal cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai quickly rose to become international metropolises, with export trade and foreign investment driving the economy. In 1993, China attracted $27 billion in foreign investment, and in Shenzhen alone, industrial output grew by over 50%. However, in stark contrast to the prosperity of the coastal areas, the rural areas in the central and western regions remained marginalized by the wave of economic reform. Land remained the primary economic reliance of farmers, with agricultural income accounting for over 80% of household income. Lacking industrialization and infrastructure, the rural areas appeared as blank spaces in the rapidly developing economic landscape.</p>

<p>这种区域间的经济鸿沟，犹如第一次和第二次工业革命的全球影响。当英国在18世纪掀起工业革命时，工业化迅速蔓延到欧洲和北美的贸易伙伴，塑造了现代发达国家。然而，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲许多国家未能被工业化的涟漪波及，依旧深陷贫困。20世纪90年代的中国，同样在经历着内部发展的不均衡——沿海地区迅速迈向现代化，而内陆农村则仍然挣扎在传统农业经济的循环中。</p>
<p>This regional economic divide is similar to the global effects of the first and second industrial revolutions. When Britain launched the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, industrialization quickly spread to Europe and North America’s trade partners, shaping modern developed countries. However, many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were not touched by the ripples of industrialization and remained trapped in poverty. In the 1990s, China also experienced internal development inequality — coastal areas rapidly moved towards modernization, while the inland rural areas struggled within the traditional agricultural economy.</p>

<p>在这样的背景下，我出生在湖南农村，这片土地远离南巡的喧嚣和改革的荣光。与沿海城市的孩子们涌向新兴学校和产业园不同，我的童年被稻田和家庭的农业生活所环绕。农忙季节，大人们弯腰插秧，而我们这些孩子们则在田埂上嬉闹，偶尔也被拉去帮忙拔草、捡稻穗。农业生产方式简单而传统，主要依靠家庭劳力，机器化几乎为零。</p>
<p>In this context, I was born in rural Hunan, far from the bustling southern tour and the glory of reform. Unlike the children in coastal cities who flocked to emerging schools and industrial parks, my childhood was surrounded by rice fields and the agricultural life of my family. During the busy farming season, adults bent over to plant rice, while we children also were being pulled into helping pull weeds or pick rice grains. The farming methods were simple and traditional, primarily relying on family labor, with almost no mechanization.</p>

<p>然而，农村的劳动并不仅限于田间耕作。成年人的命运在田野中扎根，而孩子们的生活则被另一种隐形的分离定义——父母为求更高的收入被迫外出务工，留下的孩子们成为了“留守儿童”。1992年到1998年，中国的流动人口数量从7000万迅速增长到1.2亿，这意味着近一半的农民工离开了家乡，奔赴沿海地区寻找机会。这一浪潮在城市繁荣的背后，制造了无数个分离的家庭，也让农村的童年蒙上了孤独的阴影。统计数据显示，1995年，农村地区的留守儿童数量已经超过2000万。</p>
<p>However, rural labor was not limited to the fields. Adults' fates were rooted in the land, while children's lives were defined by another form of invisible separation — parents were motivated to leave home for higher incomes in the cities, and the children left behind became "left-behind children." From 1992 to 1998, China's migrant population grew rapidly from 70 million to 120 million, meaning nearly half of the rural migrant workers left their hometowns to seek opportunities in coastal areas. This wave, behind the prosperity of the cities, created countless separated families and cast a shadow of loneliness over rural childhoods. Statistics show that by 1995, the number of left-behind children in rural areas had exceeded 20 million.</p>

<p>我就是这些留守儿童中的一员。虽然父母并没有离家太远。但每次离别，我都在村口哭得声嘶力竭，却无法阻止这场分别的循环。在那些年，我的主要陪伴来自外公外婆。他们用无声却厚重的爱为我遮挡了许多成长的寒冷，但无论如何，这种爱的形式始终带着一种无奈。田间的稻浪起伏，正如农村孩子和城市孩子之间的命运鸿沟，始终无声而深刻。</p>
<p>I was one of these left-behind children. From the time I could remember, each time they left, I cried hoarsely at the village, unable to stop the cycle of separation. During those years, my main companions were my grandfather and grandmother. They sheltered me with their silent but heavy love, protecting me from much of the coldness of growing up, but no matter how, this form of love always carried a sense of helplessness. The rice waves in the fields are like the fate gap between rural and urban children, always silent and profound.</p>

<p>在这样的农村生活中，性别的角色分化异常鲜明，重男轻女的观念仍然根深蒂固。尽管90年代初期，《中华人民共和国义务教育法》的实施让更多农村孩子进入了学校，但女孩的教育权利依旧容易在家庭经济压力下被牺牲。许多家庭将资源优先倾向于男孩，女孩则被要求早早辍学，帮助家里务农或在婚后成为他人的妻子。</p>
<p>In rural life, gender roles were starkly divided, with the concept of valuing sons over daughters still deeply entrenched. Although the implementation of the "Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China" in the early 1990s allowed more rural children to attend school, girls' educational rights were still easily sacrificed under family economic pressure. Many families prioritized resources for boys, and girls were required to drop out of school early to help with farming or become someone else's wife after marriage.</p>

<p>我的幸运在于，家人没有让我放弃读书。作为家中成绩最好的孩子，我被视为家庭的“投资”，这一点让我与许多女孩的命运大相径庭。村里的许多女孩因为性别而被剥夺了机会，而我因为天赋和努力，得以成为那个“例外”。但这种幸运也让我从小目睹了无数命运的无声割裂。我看到邻居家女孩因为辍学而在田间劳作，我也听到村里的老人常说：“生个女儿不如养头猪。”这种文化上的偏见像田间的杂草，滋长在每个家庭的土地上，让性别成为决定命运的无形枷锁。</p>
<p>My luck was that my family did not make me give up on school. As the best-performing child in the family, I was seen as the family’s "investment," which set me apart from many other girls' fates. Many girls in the village were deprived of opportunities because of their gender, while I, due to my talent and effort, became the "exception." However, this luck also made me witness countless silent ruptures of fate from a young age. I saw the girls in my neighbors' homes working in the fields due to dropping out of school, and I also heard the elderly in the village often say, "Having a daughter is worse than raising a pig." This cultural prejudice, like weeds in the fields, grew in every family’s land, making gender an invisible shackle that determined fate.</p>

<p>尽管中西部农村在改革开放的浪潮中未能直接受益，但这一时期也为未来的改变埋下了种子。农业税负开始逐渐减轻，农村教育投入逐步增加，90年代末期电视和电力的普及，让农村的生活逐渐被现代化的元素所渗透。与此同时，外出务工带回的不仅是金钱，还有城市化的观念和眼界。这种变化在90年代末并不显著，却为21世纪农村的脱贫与发展奠定了基础。</p>
<p>Although the rural areas in the central and western regions did not directly benefit from the reform and opening-up waves, this period also planted the seeds for future change. The agricultural tax burden began to gradually decrease, rural education investment steadily increased, and by the late 1990s, the popularization of television and electricity allowed modern elements to slowly penetrate rural life. Meanwhile, the money brought back by migrant workers also carried urbanization concepts and broadened horizons. This change was not significant in the late 1990s, but it laid the foundation for rural poverty alleviation and development in the 21st century.</p>

<p>然而，在那个以农业为主的年代，改革的成果依旧难以被大多数农村人触及。1998年，中国的农业劳动力仍占总劳动力的70%以上，农村人均年收入仅为沿海城市的五分之一。教育的普及率有所提高，但许多农村学校的条件依旧简陋，师资力量不足，女孩的辍学率仍居高不下。</p>
<p>However, in those agricultural-dominant years, the fruits of reform were still difficult for most rural people to touch. In 1998, agricultural labor still accounted for over 70% of the total labor force, and rural per capita income was only one-fifth of that in coastal cities. Although the education rate had improved, many rural schools were still in poor condition, with insufficient teaching staff, and the dropout rate for girls remained high.</p>

<p>站在今天的纽约，我经常反思这段特殊的成长经历。从邓小平南巡到改革开放的高歌猛进，我看到两个中国的并存：一个是崛起的城市中国，一个是缓慢变革的农村中国。我生于稻田间的土地，成长于改革的边缘，却最终跨越了这条界线。这种跨越既是幸运，也是一种责任。我常常思考，那些被留在稻田里的孩子，那些未能走出村庄的女孩，她们的命运会不会随着更多政策的倾斜而改变？</p>
<p>Today, standing in New York, I often reflect on this special growth experience. From Deng Xiaoping's southern tour to the soaring progress of reform, I see the coexistence of two Chinas: one is the rising urban China, and the other is the slowly transforming rural China. I was born in the land of rice fields, grew up on the margins of reform, but ultimately crossed this boundary. This leap is both a blessing and a responsibility. I often think about the children left in the rice fields, the girls who never left the village. Will their fate change with more policy shifts?</p>

<p>92-98年是中国现代化进程的起点，是塑造未来中国的黄金时代。而我的童年，是这一时代背景的缩影，也是农耕社会与工业社会之间的过渡体。我从未忘记稻田间的炊烟，也不会忘记那片土地的沉默。农村的故事，依然在现代化的浪潮中等待被倾听，而我，愿意成为那个讲述故事的人。</p>
<p>The period from 1992 to 1998 was the starting point of China’s modernization process, the golden age that shaped the future of China. My childhood was a microcosm of this era, also a transitional body between an agricultural society and an industrial society. I will never forget the smoke rising from the rice fields, nor will I forget the silence of that land. The story of rural China still awaits to be heard in the wave of modernization, and I am willing to be the one who tells that story.</p>
