<h2>Summary of the journal article </h2> 
<p> The process of growth has been conceptualized as a shift in meta perspective, from materialistic and rational view of the world to a more cosmic and transcendent one, normally accompanied by an increase in life satisfaction. Gretchen D., recently retired, had a recurring dream about her house evolving from a dilapidated, unfinished state to a fully furnished, taller structure. This change symbolizes her personal growth and self-actualization over time. Initially reflecting a lower state of self-development, the completed house represents her achieved sense of wholeness and integrity in retirement.
 "Becoming the person we were meant to be" involves acknowledging and integrating uncontrollable, child-like aspects of ourselves. Dreams reflecting life-review and revisiting past experiences illustrate this process. While Erikson’s ego-integrity suggests a final state of self-completion, transpersonal psychology views the later part of life as an opportunity for ongoing psychological and spiritual exploration, such as reconciling traditional beliefs with personal growth.
  
</p>
  
<p>Moody explores the role of dreams in spiritual and psychological development during midlife and old age. It builds on various theories of personal growth and development, including:

Gerotranscendence (Tornstam): The idea that older adults experience a shift in perspective towards more profound, transpersonal experiences.
Self-Actualization (Maslow): The process of realizing and fulfilling one’s potential.
Ego-Integrity (Erikson): A stage in which individuals reflect on their lives with a sense of satisfaction and acceptance.
Individuation (Jung): The process of integrating different parts of the self to achieve personal wholeness.
</p>

  <p>Moody uses dream symbols to illustrate this process, emphasizing the dual nature of self-fulfillment and self-transcendence. He references the autobiography of Helen Luke as a case study to explore these concepts in detail. The article also touches on "Conscious Aging," which involves using dream interpretation and other methods to foster personal and spiritual growth in later life.</p>

  <p>The dream depicts a spiritual retreat where you are a participant in a group led by a young woman. You bring candles, symbolizing your contribution of light and insight. An older woman, the appointed leader, arrives late and acknowledges your role. You realize and accept that you are the hands in the group, providing support rather than leading. The dream emphasizes your value in bringing light and practical help, reflecting a positive acceptance of your role and contribution.</p>
  <p>Another dream features a perilous journey in a bus driven by Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god. The bus veers off a cliff, leading to an injury but ultimately survival. This dream uses the holy mountain symbolism to represent a challenging spiritual journey, with the bus driver symbolizing divine guidance amidst danger.</p>
  <p>In the dream, you host a party at an unfamiliar country mansion. Guests symbolize different aspects of yourself: a superficial woman and a deeply spiritual man. You explore two life story boards: one showing a spiritual lineage and another, a labyrinth ending in darkness. The latter board is taken by someone you know but can’t recall by name, who then descends into the basement, symbolizing a deeper, hidden part of your journey.</p>
  <p>Gerotranscendence is symbolized by birds in dreams, representing freedom from past roles and identities. In Elizabeth's dreams, an exhausted white bird reflects the vulnerability of spiritual aspirations, while a guiding bird during a drive symbolizes spiritual guidance and the balance between progress and risk. Nanette’s dream of white doves fluttering against a window conveys a desire to preserve spiritual purity and joy.</p>
  <p>Helen Luke’s dream at age 73 reflects the challenge of individuation in later life. In the dream, she struggles with vision, first trying borrowed glasses from friends, which are inadequate. Eventually, she realizes she had her own glasses all along but had been using them upside down. Once corrected, her vision clears, symbolizing the need to see life through one’s own perspective rather than relying on borrowed beliefs or methods. This dream illustrates the process of moving away from imitating others and internalizing one’s own genuine understanding, a key aspect of achieving ego integrity and avoiding despair in old age.</p>
  <p>Helen Luke's dream reflects the journey toward individuation and self-realization in later life. Initially, she faces challenges reaching a party, symbolizing the difficulty in pursuing personal goals. Despite having ample resources, she prefers a workaday fishing schooner over a yacht, which symbolizes a preference for simplicity and authenticity. Unable to make the boat move, she decides to swim, embracing the transformative and powerful water. The swim represents a personal struggle and growth, and upon reaching the shore and the summer house, she achieves a sense of fulfillment and strength from the journey. The dream emphasizes the importance of trusting one’s own path and inner resources for personal growth and completion.</p>

<h2>Takeaway & personal reflections</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, I experienced severe depression, symbolized by a simple house in my mind—a house with a study and a lawn, representing my yearning to cultivate an ideal inner world. This vision inspired me to create a GitHub account, which, though currently shared with only a few, I hope will evolve into an inner mental garden where I can invite others in.</p>
<p>In Washington DC, I had the opportunity to have my own space for the first time in my life, with Miko and Lee's help in decorating my apartment. This milestone marked a significant stage in my maturation - I worked extremely hard to get that space for myself. Due to my parents' excessive absence and harsh upbringing during my formative years, I decided to leave them since middle school, and our time together amounts to less than four years. Yeah, it was my own decision to stay as far as I could from my family - I want independence and freedom. Without traditional social education and experience, I relied on self-learning and conversations with wise individuals to shape my identity and understand social behavior. This unconventional upbringing has shaped my unique character and thought processes, setting me apart from my peers and being a non-conformist.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my dreams, I often think of my grandparents and their home—a place of humble beginnings. They lived a simple life in a broken house, lacking modern conveniences, even a toilet. Yet, it remains my favorite house. As a child, I secretly wished I could buy them a better home. Now, with the means to do so, they are no longer with us.</p>
<p>During my childhood, I discovered my authentic self—a quiet and shy girl who loved studying and asking questions, eagerly listened to my grandfather's stories, and cherished my grandmother's nurturing care. This was one of the few times I felt genuinely cared for and experienced unconditional love. I often felt most like myself when surrounded by people who were authentic and caring, as it allowed me to lower my guards and truly be at ease.</p>
<p>My grandparents had a profound impact on me. Their influence shines through in my volunteer work—preparing meals for seniors in the senior center, motivating homeless individuals to persevere and pursue their dreams in the street, and offering free classes to students in need while in China. These acts reflect the caring and compassionate values they instilled in me. However, living in NYC over the past few years has suppressed this part of me, as vulnerability was often seen as a weakness and easily exploited. Consequently, I learned to conceal my emotions and guard my true self.</p>
