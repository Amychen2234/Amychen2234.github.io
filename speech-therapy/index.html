      <ul>
        <li> Your feelings when you are with people you are familar with and with people you are unfamilar with</li>
        <p> Calm and safe vs nervous and anxious</p>
        <li> Your position when you feel secure and insecure</li>
        <p> Sit straight, stand tall with your head up and chest out vs your body huddled</p>
        <li> Set emotional boundry: push unwanted energy away</li>
        <p> Closing your eyes, imagine a scenario where you feel most secure and most anxious</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>Takeaway: this is my first time doing speech therapy, and I find it incredibly helpful. My motivation stemmed from communication issues in both professional and personal settings. There was a significant gap between what I intended to convey and how others perceived my communication, leading to misunderstandings, reputation damage, and strained relationships. I wanted to improve my life and communication skills, so I enrolled in speech training classes. This training has pushed me into both my comfort and discomfort zones, making me aware of how my energy levels affect my interactions. When I'm in my comfort zone, I can express my thoughts and opinions clearly. Understanding my environment helps me connect with others more easily.The journey through speech training should help me repair the damage caused by disconnection from myself and others.

      <h2>Session 2: 7/3/2024 30min</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Challenges in small talk and social interactions</li>
          <p>1) Great at small talk but struggle with silence and uncomfortable with pauses in conversation. Why? Fear of being disliked and tendency to people-please without prioritizing personal preferences.</p>
          <p>2) Tendency to ask many questions without leaving room for other person to reciprocate. Why? Others might show lack of curiosity and a desire to impress others and want to build trust instantly.</p>
          <li>Internal reflections</li>
          <p>1) Recognition that self-trust is a challenge in various aspects of life and acknowledgement of high personal standards leading to pressure and difficulty in meeting them. </p>
          <p>2) Insight into the power of listening to build self-trust and calmness in interactions and acknowledgement to give oneself permission to take ownership and create personal rules.</p>
          <li>Top practices to work on</li>
          <p>1) Self-awareness: keep a journal noting likes/dislikes, feelings during interactions (anxious or calm) and use the journal to analyze and improve my approach to social interactions</p>
          <p>2) Build self-trust: focus on trusting yourself to follow through on intentions or actions and maintain a record of instances where you've trusted yourself well and where improvement is needed. Use these records to enhance consistency and confidence in social interactions.</p>
          <p>3) Balanced conversational approach: during conversations, aim for a balanced exchange of questions and personal sharing and allow space for the other person to ask questions and share thoughts without feeling pressured to lead the conversation. Embrace pauses and allow conversations to unfold naturally, revealing aspects of yourself over time.</p>
          <p>4) Ownership and rule setting: recognize the importance of setting your own rules in social interactions to reduce pressure and enhance authenticity and view the process of improving social skills as an art and a journey towards becoming the person you aspire to be.</p>
         <p>Takeaway: Once again, I find speech therapy incredibly helpful. As I become more mindful of my social interactions and emotions, I am starting to recognize my coping mechanisms. In the past, I read books on how to make friends and gain others' trust, but they mainly focused on following rules and techniques. In recent years, to cope with stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem, I stopped listening to both myself and others. My communication was driven by my own insecurity.</p>
          <p>I remember watching the TED talk below more than 10 times since 2016. It is easier said than done to have good conversations. I did the opposite of its advice, especially in the past few years: I was self-centered, talked to impress, spoke excessively, and showed little interest in others. As I become more at peace with my emotions, I am beginning to pay more attention to both the other person and myself. Did I respond just to please others? Did I fully understand what the other person wanted to say? Now, I am still learning more about my communication patterns, but I notice my listening skills have much improved.</p>

    <h2>Session 3: 7/8/2024 30min </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Challenges in staying focused on one topic and managing negative interactions/boundries. </li>
        <p> 1) Try to stay on the same topic with guidance by asking questions - a good way to get to know them and their interests and focus on the topic.</p>
        <p> 2) Wait for people to answer your questions so that you can ask the next questions - stay on the same topic and keep the same topic for a period of time. </p>
        <p> 3) Notice that you sometimes feel nervous and uncertain about whether others are interested in the topic of conversation. Instead of constantly second-guessing their interests, which may lead to overthinking and rapid topic changes, you can practice on mindfullness to focus on what the other person is saying vs letting your mind wander to possible reactions or judgement. This behavior stems from concerns about how others might feel or react, which can distract you from truly listening to and engaging with what others are sharing.fter conversations, reflect on what went well and what you might improve. Did you listen actively? Did you stay focused on the topic? Learning from each interaction can help you feel more confident in future conversations.</p>
        <p> 4) Can focus on the nature of the conversation vs if moving too quickly and not allowing the person to pause and give them space. Some people may not know how to move the conversations - you may feel it is your responsibility to keep the conversation going. So you are not doing something wrong. Can be one-sided if you don't allow the other person to go deeper into the topic or ask questions.</p>
        <p> 5) When dealing with phone calls where others may speak critically or condescendingly, it's crucial to manage your energy. Maintain good posture and stand upright to assert control over the situation; slouching can exacerbate negative feelings. Consider shortening the conversation if it becomes particularly detrimental; a negative interaction can impact your mood for days. If someone makes you feel inferior, use it as an opportunity to strengthen your self-esteem, assert boundaries, and establish autonomy. This approach empowers you to reshape the dynamics of your interactions.</p>
