        <li> Your feelings when you are with people you are familar with and with people you are unfamilar with</li>
        <p> Calm and safe vs nervous and anxious</p>
        <li> Your position when you feel secure and insecure</li>
        <p> Sit straight, stand tall with your head up and chest out vs your body huddled</p>
        <li> Set emotional boundry: push unwanted energy away</li>
        <p> Closing your eyes, imagine a scenario where you feel most secure and most anxious</p>

        <p></p>Takeaway: this is my first time doing speech therapy, and I find it incredibly helpful. My motivation stemmed from communication issues in both professional and personal settings. There was a significant gap between what I intended to convey and how others perceived my communication, leading to misunderstandings, reputation damage, and strained relationships. I wanted to improve my life and communication skills, so I enrolled in speech training classes. This training has pushed me into both my comfort and discomfort zones, making me aware of how my energy levels affect my interactions. When I'm in my comfort zone, I can express my thoughts and opinions clearly. Understanding my environment helps me connect with others more easily.The journey through speech training should help me repair the damage caused by disconnection from myself and others.

      <ul>
          <li>Challenges in small talk and social interactions</li>
          <p>1) Great at small talk but struggle with silence and uncomfortable with pauses in conversation. Why? Fear of being disliked and tendency to people-please without prioritizing personal preferences.</p>
          <p>2) Tendency to ask many questions without leaving room for other person to reciprocate. Why? Others might show lack of curiosity and a desire to impress others and want to build trust instantly.</p>
          <li>Internal reflections</li>
          <p>Recognition that self-trust is a challenge in various aspects of life and acknowledgement of high personal standards leading to pressure and difficulty in meeting them. </p>
          <p>Insight into the power of listening to build self-trust and calmness in interactions and acknowledgement to give onself permission to take ownership and create personal rules.</p>
          <li>Top practices to work on</li>
          <p>1) Self-awareness: keep a journal noting likes/dislikes, feelings during interactions (anxious or calm) and use the journal to anayze and improve my approach to social interactions</p>
          <p>2) Build self-trust: focus on trusting yourself to follow through on intentions or actions and maintain a record of instances where you've trusted yourself well and where improvement is needed. Use these records to enhance consistency and confidence in social interactions.</p>
          <p>3) Balanced conversational approach: during conversations, aim for a balanced exchange of questions and personal sharing and allow space for the other person to ask questions and share thoughts without feeling pressured to lead the conversation. Embrace pauses and allow conversations to unfold naturally, revealing aspects of yourself over time.</p>
          <p>4) Ownership and rule setting: recognize the importance of setting your own rules in social interactions to reduce pressure and enhance authenticity and view the process of improving social skills as an art and a journey towards becoming the person you aspire to be.</p>
