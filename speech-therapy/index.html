        <p></p>Takeaway: this is my first time doing speech therapy, and I find it incredibly helpful. My motivation stemmed from communication issues in both professional and personal settings. There was a significant gap between what I intended to convey and how others perceived my communication, leading to misunderstandings, reputation damage, and strained relationships. I wanted to improve my life and communication skills, so I enrolled in speech training classes. This training has pushed me into both my comfort and discomfort zones, making me aware of how my energy levels affect my interactions. When I'm in my comfort zone, I can express my thoughts and opinions clearly. Understanding my environment helps me connect with others more easily.The journey through speech training should help me repair the damage caused by disconnection from myself and others.
