        <h1>Chess & Dating</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Pattern recognition: most guys I have dated are into chess and some are exceptionally good. Hence, guys who are into chess are more attractive to me compared with these who are not.</h2>
            <p>Why did I become interested in playing chess? For winning! 有强烈的好胜心 - I have a strong desire to win! Playing chess has always reminded me of blindspots in my decision-making process as well as a lack of planing when making a move. As I am training myself in this game, I am also adopting new habits in my thought-process. For example, I now practice on thinking things through before I speak. A lack of filtering in my words have brought me unnecessary trouble before. Hence, I see the game of chess as an effective way for me to develop calmness. </p>
            <p>Speaking of dating, I have met someone who is not only passionate about playing chess but also was so patient teaching me. He really helped ignate my passion in chess. Our dating was centered on chess and we even attended a tournement together. He became someone special to me as I thought of him sometimes when I play chess. Sometimes I am even thinking what it takes for me to fall for a boy. Someone who is willing to teach me something new or help me to grow or improve on some aspects of myself. As I fall for the process of learning, I also fall for this person.</p>
