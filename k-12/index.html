<h1>K-12: Navigating Rural, Urban, and Provincial Education | K-12求学时代 (1998-2011)：从农村、小城市到省会城市的求学之旅，休学去沿海工厂打工的插曲 </h1>

<h1>K-12: Navigating Rural, Urban, and Provincial Education | K-12求学时代 (1998-2011)：从农村、小城市到省会城市的求学之旅，休学去沿海工厂打工的插曲 | 中国城市化浪潮、农民工北上广打工潮与教育改革</h1>

<p>我的求学之路，既是一场地理上的迁徙，也是一段灵魂深处的流浪。从乡村的阡陌农田到省会城市的街头霓虹，这些年我跨越的不仅是空间，更是时代的断裂与自我的重塑。在中国城市化浪潮和教育改革的洪流中，我的成长犹如一颗沙砾，被裹挟、磨砺，最终雕刻出锋利的棱角。</p>

<h2>初中：乡村到小城市的裂痕</h2>

<p>外公外婆的家是我童年的避风港，一个简单却充满温暖的地方。在那里，我的需求得到了满足，感受到无条件的爱。然而，随着他们相继去世，我的生活被迫进入一个全新的阶段：回到父母身边。这不仅是空间上的变化，更是一场情感上的震荡，是我成长道路上的第一道裂痕。在父母家，我很快意识到，这个环境与外公外婆家截然不同。母亲的脾气暴躁且控制欲极强，父亲则沉默寡言，几乎不干涉任何事情。家中的气氛压抑而冷漠，缺乏安全感和情感支持。这样的环境让我迅速明白，我无法依赖他人，必须为自己争取一切。</p>

<p>Grandpa and Grandma's house was my childhood refuge, a simple yet warm place. There, my needs were met, and I felt unconditional love. However, as they passed away one after another, my life was forced into a new phase: returning to my parents. This was not only a spatial change but an emotional shock, marking the first crack in my growth journey. At my parents' house, I quickly realized that this environment was very different from my grandparents'. My mother's temper was volatile and controlling, while my father was taciturn, hardly interfering in anything. The atmosphere at home was oppressive and cold, lacking safety and emotional support. In this environment, I quickly learned that I couldn't rely on others and had to fight for everything myself.</p>

<p>起初，我对母亲的批评逆来顺受，甚至努力通过优秀的表现来寻求她的认可。我以优异的成绩赢得老师的表扬，主动承担农活和家务活，想要证明自己是“好女儿”。然而，无论我多么努力，母亲的批评却从未停止。这让我开始怀疑：是否是我不够好？但初中生物课的一堂课改变了我。当老师讲到基因的概念时，我突然领悟到，或许父母对我的期待并不是出于爱，而是因为我承载了他们的基因。这份认知令我震惊，也让我第一次质疑“爱”的本质。</p>

<p>At first, I passively accepted my mother's criticism and even tried to earn her approval through excellent performance. I won praise from my teachers with outstanding grades, voluntarily took on farming and housework, trying to prove that I was a "good daughter". However, no matter how hard I tried, my mother's criticism never stopped. This made me begin to doubt: am I not good enough? But one biology class in junior high school changed me. When the teacher talked about the concept of genes, I suddenly realized that perhaps my parents' expectations were not out of love, but because I carried their genes. This realization shocked me and made me question the essence of "love" for the first time.</p>

<p>这份认知令我震惊，也让我第一次质疑“爱”的本质。这种怀疑埋下了叛逆的种子。我开始不再完全服从母亲的控制，而是尝试以自己的方式表达抗议。最初，我在争吵中抬高音量，后来用课堂上学到的知识反驳她。这些反抗是对自我力量的试探，也是对压迫环境的微弱抵抗。但母亲的行为却愈发极端：她撕毁我的课外书，丢掉我心爱的衣物，甚至在全班同学面前大喊让我退学。这样的羞辱让我既愤怒又绝望，同时催生了一种强烈的愿望：离开这个家，越远越好。我在14岁的时候就在心中决定要从家庭中独立出来远走高飞。</p>

<p>This realization shocked me and made me question the essence of "love" for the first time. This doubt planted the seed of rebellion. I began to no longer fully obey my mother's control, but instead, I tried to express my protest in my own way. At first, I raised my voice in arguments, and later, I used the knowledge I learned in class to contradict her. These acts of rebellion were a trial of my own strength and a faint resistance to the oppressive environment. However, my mother's behavior became more extreme: she tore up my extracurricular books, threw away my beloved clothes, and even shouted in front of the whole class, telling me to drop out. This humiliation made me both angry and desperate, while also giving birth to a strong desire: to leave this house, as far as possible. At the age of 14, I made up my mind to break free from my family and fly away to independence.</p>

<p>相比母亲的严厉与羞辱，父亲的沉默让我感受到一种截然不同的无助。他偶尔表现出的关爱，例如默默递牛奶、送我上学，虽温暖，却如同昙花一现。他从未真正站出来保护我，这种缺席的父爱让我觉得自己被孤立在家庭的争斗之中。这种孤立感，日后也延续到了我的人际关系中，让我对他人的关爱与支持产生深深的怀疑。</p>

<p>Compared to my mother's harshness and humiliation, my father's silence made me feel a completely different kind of helplessness. The occasional care he showed, such as quietly handing me milk or sending me to school, was warm but fleeting. He never truly stood up to protect me, and this absence of paternal love made me feel isolated in the family struggles. This sense of isolation would later continue into my relationships with others, making me deeply suspicious of the care and support of others.</p>

<p>与家庭的压抑形成鲜明对比的是学校带来的短暂喘息。我的成绩始终名列前茅，老师的表扬让我感受到被认可的喜悦。我在学校交到了朋友，甚至得到了一些男生的青睐。但农村的初中环境相对封闭，大家居住得很近，彼此之间的熟悉感掩盖不了贫乏与单调。这种环境让我感到窒息，然而随着互联网的兴起，一扇通往新世界的窗户被打开。QQ、网络游戏以及网吧成为我们那个时代最令人兴奋的活动之一。通过互联网，我第一次接触到乡村以外的世界。这种连接让我蠢蠢欲动，渴望逃离这个闭塞的地方。初三时，我终于找到了机会转学到益阳市的一所重点初中，寄居在亲戚家中。</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to the oppression at home, school provided a brief respite. My grades were consistently at the top, and the praise from my teachers made me feel recognized. I made friends at school, and even received some attention from boys. However, the rural junior high environment was relatively closed, and despite the familiarity of living close together, it could not hide the poverty and monotony. This environment made me feel suffocated, but with the rise of the internet, a window to a new world was opened. QQ, online games, and internet cafes became some of the most exciting activities for us at that time. Through the internet, I first came into contact with the world outside the village. This connection made me restless, yearning to escape from this enclosed place. In my third year of middle school, I finally found the opportunity to transfer to a key middle school in Yiyang, where I stayed with relatives.</p>

<p>我寄居的亲戚是村里最受尊敬的知识分子：叔爷爷是大学生，叔奶奶是一名医生。他们为我从乡村转到城市提供了可能。在他们家，我听到了许多关于他们早年奋斗与牺牲的故事，接触到了知识分子的视角。他们家的故事和书籍，仿佛为我打开了一扇通往更广阔世界的大门。即使当时住在客厅，没有自己的私人空间，但我非常珍惜与他们共度的时光。</p>

<p>The relatives I stayed with were the most respected intellectuals in the village: Uncle Grandpa was a university graduate, and Aunt Grandma was a doctor. They made it possible for me to move from the countryside to the city. In their home, I heard many stories of their early struggles and sacrifices, and I was exposed to an intellectual perspective. Their stories and books seemed to open a door for me to a broader world. Although I stayed in the living room at that time, without my own private space, I cherished the time spent with them.</p>

<p>相比乡村学校，城市的教学条件和同学们的家庭背景都丰富得多。然而，这样的环境也让我面临前所未有的身份冲突：我是从乡村来的“外人”。我的口音、穿着和言行总是吸引注意，成为被议论的对象。尽管我成绩优秀，但我仍感受到深深的隔阂。同学们不一定因此接纳我，而我也无法融入他们的圈子。这种生活的孤独感，叠加母亲施加的压力，让我不敢表现出真实的情感。内心的愤怒与挫败被压抑得越来越深，最终埋下了一颗种子：逃离，我想逃去一个让我感觉安定和可以做自己的地方。</p>

<p>Compared to the rural school, the teaching conditions in the city and the family backgrounds of the classmates were much richer. However, this environment also made me face an unprecedented identity conflict: I was an "outsider" from the countryside. My accent, clothing, and behavior always attracted attention and became subjects of gossip. Although I had excellent grades, I still felt a deep sense of alienation. My classmates didn't necessarily accept me because of this, and I couldn't fit into their circles. This sense of loneliness, compounded by the pressure from my mother, made me afraid to show my true feelings. The anger and frustration inside me were suppressed more and more, eventually planting a seed: to escape, I wanted to go to a place where I could feel stable and be myself.</p>

<p>如今回头看，我的初中阶段不仅是个人成长的起点，也是中国社会快速变迁的缩影。在那个城乡差距巨大、城市化加速的时代，我个人的挣扎与这片土地的变化紧密相连。乡村的压抑与单调、城市的陌生与排斥，以及教育的有限性，共同塑造了我的世界观。</p>

<p>Looking back, my junior high school stage was not only the starting point of my personal growth but also a microcosm of China's rapid social changes. In an era of huge urban-rural disparities and accelerated urbanization, my personal struggles were closely linked to the changes of this land. The oppression and monotony of the countryside, the strangeness and rejection of the city, and the limitations of education together shaped my worldview.</p>



<h1>高中：小城市的停滞与省会的重生</h1>

<p>在高中的第一学期期中考试中，我轻松考了全校第一。然而，从外公外婆家到父母身边，再到高中校园的这段迁徙并没有让我感到成就感，反而带来了深深的压抑。成绩的优秀并没有驱散我心中的疑问：“读书的意义究竟是什么？” 当时，这个问题像一道无法解开的谜题，让我开始厌倦枯燥的课业和日复一日的重复生活。我向父母提出休学的想法时，他们起初并不当真，以为这只是青少年的叛逆。然而，当我彻底停止上学，他们才意识到事态的严重性。亲戚们纷纷登门劝说，但没人能给我一个让我信服的答案。学习不是我的抗争，而是对“生活”的抗议。最终，我做了一个当时看来是大胆而绝望的决定：假借一张身份证，去江苏投奔正在沿海工厂打工的姐姐。对于一个来自农村的女孩来说，社会提供的选项少得可怜。我起初在网吧做收银员，后来到服装店卖衣服，最后进入了工厂。这段经历的时间虽然短暂，却让我体会到了从未感受过的深渊。</p>

<p>In the first semester of high school, I easily ranked first in the whole school. However, the transition from my grandparents' house to my parents' and then to high school did not bring me a sense of achievement; instead, it brought a deep sense of oppression. My excellent grades did not dispel the question in my mind: "What is the meaning of studying?" At that time, this question felt like an unsolvable riddle, and I began to grow weary of the dull coursework and the repetitive daily life. When I proposed the idea of dropping out of school to my parents, they initially did not take it seriously, thinking it was just teenage rebellion. However, when I stopped attending school completely, they realized the seriousness of the situation. Relatives came to persuade me, but no one could provide me with an answer that convinced me. Studying was not my struggle, but a protest against "life." In the end, I made a bold and seemingly desperate decision: I borrowed an ID card and went to Jiangsu to join my sister who was working in a coastal factory. For a girl from the countryside, the social options were incredibly limited. I initially worked as a cashier in an internet cafe, then sold clothes in a clothing store, and finally joined the factory. Although the time spent there was brief, it exposed me to a depth I had never felt before.</p>

<h2>工厂生活让我第一次近距离接触到“命运”的重量。工作单调而重复，人与人之间疏离而冷漠，整个世界像是一台不知疲倦的机器。在流水线上，一分一秒都被拉长成永恒，我感到自己的未来仿佛被锁在这片拥挤又无望的工厂里。我甚至搭过陌生人的车，也遭遇过男性的骚扰。生活的恐惧感在压迫中迅速蔓延。更让我痛苦的是，家庭的支持也变得遥不可及。与姐姐住在一起的日子时常充满冲突，她无法理解我沉默中的抗议，甚至用拳脚回应我的不服从。在这个陌生的城市里，我没有安全感，更没有归属感。那段时间，我常常在黑暗中发问：如果努力只是换来这样的生活，那努力的意义又在哪里？这种反思推动了我的第二个决定：回家，重新开始。</h2>

<p>Factory life brought me face to face with the weight of "fate" for the first time. The work was monotonous and repetitive, and the people were distant and cold; the whole world felt like a tireless machine. On the assembly line, every minute and second felt stretched into eternity, and I felt as though my future was locked in this crowded and hopeless factory. I even hitchhiked with strangers and experienced male harassment. The sense of fear in life spread quickly in the oppression. What made it even more painful was that family support had become distant and unreachable. Living with my sister was often filled with conflict, as she couldn’t understand my silent protest, even responding to my disobedience with physical force. In this unfamiliar city, I had no sense of security and no sense of belonging. During that time, I often asked myself in the darkness: if effort only leads to this kind of life, then what is the meaning of effort? This reflection led to my second decision: to go back home and start over.</p>

<h2>回到家后，得益于我之前优异的成绩，家里亲戚为我争取到了乡下一所当地高中的全额奖学金，我得以再次进入高中。最初的一切都显得那么简单，我很快又考到了全校第一。然而，这种轻松与得意也带来了新的问题——我对老师的不满与挑衅变得更加强烈，尤其是化学老师的一次公开羞辱，彻底点燃了我的愤怒。那是我生命中第一次尝试掌控自己的命运，不再逆来顺受。在愤然离校后，我凭借自己的努力寻找转学的机会。一所省会城市的私立学校破例允许我参加入学考试，我的数学与英语成绩让他们印象深刻。在我大胆地向校方争取全额奖学金后，他们意外地同意了我的请求。这一刻，我第一次感受到“争取”带来的力量，也第一次开始相信，自己的声音是可以被听到的。</h2>

<p>After returning home, thanks to my previous excellent grades, my relatives helped me secure a full scholarship to a local high school in the countryside, allowing me to return to high school. Everything seemed so simple at first, and I quickly ranked first in the whole school again. However, this ease and pride also brought new problems—my dissatisfaction and provocation towards the teachers grew even stronger, especially after a public humiliation by my chemistry teacher, which completely ignited my anger. That was the first time in my life that I tried to take control of my own fate and no longer passively accepted things. After leaving school angrily, I used my own efforts to find an opportunity to transfer schools. A private school in the provincial capital made an exception and allowed me to take the entrance exam. My math and English grades impressed them. When I boldly requested a full scholarship from the school, they unexpectedly agreed to my request. At that moment, I first felt the power of "fighting for something" and began to believe that my voice could be heard.</p>

<h2>新的学校给了我完全不同的体验。因为是私立学校，这里的班级人数较少，学生是湖南各地的择优录取，同学们关系紧密，贫富差距被校服掩盖，几乎不再是被关注的焦点。学校的支持和老师的关怀让我感到久违的温暖，尤其是生物老师的一次贴心询问——她发现我有些不合群，主动问我是否想家。这种温柔的关心让我仿佛又回到了外公外婆的家中。在这里，我交到了许多朋友，许多至今仍是我生命中的挚友。这种平等与接纳让我第一次体会到归属感的力量。但再温暖的校园，面对高考时的竞争压力也会显得严峻。在学校的外教课上，我第一次与外国老师交流。他们的思想深度、表达方式和游历的经验激发了我对更大世界的向往。从那时起，我开始渴望探索世界，甚至希望有一天能够出国留学。我给许多英国和美国的学校写信，倾诉自己的梦想。然而，大部分邮件没有收到任何回复。当我多年后重新读到这些邮件时，心中充满了复杂的情感。那个渴望自由的自己，那些无法寄达的信件，见证了我成长中的挣扎和对更美好生活的追求。</h2>

<p>The new school gave me a completely different experience. Because it was a private school, the class sizes were smaller, and the students were selected from all over Hunan, so the relationships between students were tight, and the differences in wealth were covered by school uniforms, making them almost no longer the focus of attention. The support from the school and the care from the teachers gave me a warmth I hadn't felt in a long time, especially after a thoughtful inquiry from my biology teacher—she noticed that I seemed a bit isolated and kindly asked if I missed home. This gentle concern made me feel as if I was back in my grandparents' house. Here, I made many friends, many of whom are still dear to me today. This sense of equality and acceptance allowed me to experience the power of belonging for the first time. But no matter how warm the campus, the competition pressure during the college entrance exam was still intense. During an English class with a foreign teacher, I had my first exchange with foreign teachers. Their depth of thought, manner of expression, and travel experience sparked my longing for a bigger world. From that moment, I began to yearn to explore the world and even hoped that one day I could study abroad. I wrote letters to many schools in the UK and the US, sharing my dreams. However, most of the letters never received a response. When I read those letters again many years later, my heart was filled with complex emotions. The version of me who longed for freedom, those undelivered letters, witnessed my struggles and my pursuit of a better life during my growth.</p>

<h2>高中阶段，我经历了自我意识的觉醒，也感受到系统对个体的冷漠。从工厂的绝望，到学校的温暖，这段旅程让我明白了一件事：归属感是需要自己创造的。只有通过挣扎与抗争，我才可能掌控自己的命运。这段经历不仅是我个人的故事，也是那个时代中国社会剧烈变化的缩影。城市化、教育改革、农村与城市的巨大落差，都影响着我的成长轨迹。在对抗中，我找到了自己的声音；在流动中，我学会了与世界对话；在孤独中，我逐渐学会了与自己和解。</h2>

<p>During high school, I experienced the awakening of self-awareness and also felt the system’s indifference to the individual. From the despair in the factory to the warmth at school, this journey taught me one thing: belonging is something you must create for yourself. Only through struggle and resistance can I truly take control of my own destiny. This experience is not only my personal story but also a microcosm of the dramatic changes in Chinese society during that era. Urbanization, educational reform, and the vast disparity between rural and urban areas all influenced my path of growth. Through resistance, I found my voice; through movement, I learned to communicate with the world; through loneliness, I gradually learned to reconcile with myself.</p>




  
<h1>大学：迷茫与叛逆之间，走向世界的道路</h1>

<p>高考并非如预期所理想，我进入中国的一所二本院校。我陷入了一种深刻的怀疑之中：努力的意义是什么？ 我像无数个同龄人一样，在应试教育的体系中被定义、被规范，被告知什么是“正确的人生轨迹”。可我始终觉得，脚下那条所谓“被规划好”的路，像一张网，把我束缚在了某种沉闷的规则中，喘不过气。</p>

<p>My college entrance exam results were not as expected, and I ended up in a second-tier university in China. I fell into a deep sense of doubt: What is the meaning of effort? Like countless peers, I was defined, standardized, and told what the "correct life path" was in the system of exam-oriented education. However, I always felt that the so-called "pre-planned" path beneath my feet was like a net, trapping me in some dull rules, suffocating me.</p>

<p>高中毕业后，我兼职在长沙街头发传单，开始接触一个与课堂完全不同的世界。那些普通人的目光，那些街角小巷中的对话，让我感到一种从未体验过的真实。这种真实带着粗粝的质感，也让我第一次意识到，真实生活远比考试排名的次序要复杂得多。 这种复杂让我既害怕，又无法抗拒。恐惧的深处，是一种隐隐的兴奋：或许，我可以走上一条与他人截然不同的道路。填志愿时，我没有听从任何人的建议。我独自去了长沙的图书馆，翻阅着一本本专业目录，试图在陌生的字句间找到通向未来的答案。最终，我选中了两个我认为更具前景的方向：计算机和生物工程。然而，计算机并没有引起我的兴趣，而康宝莱的经历让我意识到，生物工程可能是一个极具前景的领域。</p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I worked part-time distributing flyers on the streets of Changsha and started to experience a world completely different from the classroom. The gazes of ordinary people, the conversations in the corners and alleys, made me feel a raw kind of realness that I had never experienced before. This realness had a rough texture, and it made me realize for the first time that real life is much more complex than the order of exam rankings. This complexity made me both afraid and unable to resist. Deep within the fear, there was a subtle excitement: perhaps, I could walk a path completely different from others. When it was time to fill out my college application, I did not listen to anyone's advice. I went to the library in Changsha alone, flipping through professional directories, trying to find the answers to my future among the unfamiliar words. In the end, I selected two directions I believed had better prospects: computer science and bioengineering. However, computer science did not spark my interest, and my experience with Herbalife made me realize that bioengineering might be an extremely promising field.</p>

<p>背着“离家越远越好”的念头，我来到北方的一所大学。这片土地对我来说既陌生又新奇，但很快，我意识到，校园中的人似乎并不热衷于知识。恋爱、社交、学生会和实习成了大多数人生活的中心，而我却始终渴望某种更深刻的东西——一种能解释世界的逻辑，一种能打破局限的力量。我开始远离无谓的社交，独自泡在图书馆中，把书架上的书从头到尾翻阅一遍。从文化到心理学，从哲学到政治，我像是在解答一道关于自我的复杂方程。 然而，这种探索是孤独的。周围的人并不理解我对知识的狂热，甚至觉得我“脱离现实”。但对我来说，那些沉浸在书页间的时光，像是一种救赎——在这个被规则定义的世界里，它让我找到了一片属于自己的自由天地。</p>

<p>With the thought of "the farther away from home, the better," I came to a university in the north. This land was both unfamiliar and new to me, but soon I realized that the people on campus seemed not interested in knowledge. Love, socializing, student unions, and internships became the center of most people's lives, while I always longed for something deeper—a logic that could explain the world, a force that could break limitations. I started to distance myself from meaningless socializing and immersed myself in the library, reading through the books on the shelves from start to finish. From culture to psychology, from philosophy to politics, I was like solving a complex equation about myself. However, this exploration was lonely. People around me did not understand my obsession with knowledge and even thought I was "out of touch with reality." But for me, those hours spent immersed in books felt like a form of redemption—in this world defined by rules, it allowed me to find a space of freedom that belonged to me.</p>

<p>到了大三，我对课堂的内容彻底失去了兴趣。那些标准化的知识点和预设的正确答案让我觉得无聊透顶。于是，我开始寻找体制之外的资源：我自学德语和英语，跟来自全世界的人交流，听TED演讲、Coursera、网易公开课。我在虚拟的课堂里，接触到了哈佛的《幸福课》和《正义》、还有耶鲁的《金融市场》，这些课程让我第一次认识到，教育并不仅仅是考试的工具，而是打开未知世界的钥匙。其中一门课程——《如何改变世界》——彻底改变了我的人生轨迹。课程中，教授讲解了全球性问题、社会不平等和可持续发展的议题。这些话题对一个来自中国农村的女孩来说，我一开始的动机就是想知道这教授会如何胡说八道并用我学习的知识嘲讽他。 但正是在这门课上，我结识了一位英国人C。他对中国的兴趣让我感到奇怪，他谈论联合国、世界银行，描述那些对全球格局产生深远影响的项目与人物。我听得好奇又质疑，那是一个完全不同于我所熟悉的世界，一个不被“成败”二元框架束缚的世界。如果我不懂，但是这个他描述的世界远远比我所处的封闭和不开放的环境更有意思，所以我们保持了联系。</p>

<p>By the third year, I had completely lost interest in the content of the classes. The standardized knowledge points and preset correct answers made me feel bored to the core. So, I began to look for resources outside the system: I self-studied German and English, communicated with people from all over the world, and listened to TED talks, Coursera, and NetEase Open Courses. In virtual classrooms, I was exposed to Harvard's "Happiness" and "Justice" courses, and Yale's "Financial Markets." These courses made me realize for the first time that education is not just a tool for exams, but a key to unlocking the unknown world. One course—"How to Change the World"—completely changed the trajectory of my life. The professor talked about global issues, social inequality, and sustainable development. For a girl from rural China, my initial motivation was to see how the professor would talk nonsense and mock him with the knowledge I had learned. But it was in this course that I met a British person, C. His interest in China puzzled me. He talked about the United Nations, the World Bank, and described projects and people that had a profound impact on the global landscape. I listened with curiosity and skepticism; it was a world completely different from what I was familiar with, a world not bound by the binary framework of "success or failure." Even though I didn't understand, the world he described was far more interesting than the closed and unopen environment I was in, so we stayed in touch.</p>

<p>大学即将毕业时，C邀请我参加世界儿童艺术节，并愿意资助我全部的费用。这是一份不可思议的礼物，也是我人生第一次感受到跨越边界的可能性。 带着忐忑与希望，我踏上了飞往华盛顿的航班。当飞机降落时，我透过舷窗望向那片陌生的土地，心中浮现的是一种复杂的情感：恐惧、兴奋，还有一种久违的自由。站在华盛顿特区的街头，我第一次感受到什么叫做“人类的共同命运”。这座城市的每一面墙、每一块广告牌都在谈论环境保护、教育改革和人权。在那个瞬间，我忽然意识到：这不正是我一直寻找的世界吗？一个追求公正与美好的地方，一个相信每个人都有力量去改变命运的舞台。</p>

<p>As I was about to graduate from university, C invited me to attend the World Children's Art Festival and was willing to sponsor all of my expenses. This was an incredible gift and the first time I felt the possibility of crossing boundaries. With both anxiety and hope, I boarded a flight to Washington, D.C. When the plane landed, I looked out the window at the unfamiliar land, and a complex emotion arose in my heart: fear, excitement, and a long-lost sense of freedom. Standing on the streets of Washington, D.C., I felt for the first time what "humanity's shared fate" meant. Every wall and billboard in this city talked about environmental protection, education reform, and human rights. In that moment, I suddenly realized: this is the world I have always been looking for? A place that pursues justice and beauty, a stage that believes everyone has the power to change their fate.</p>



<h1> 成长在断裂中的农村孩子：经济改革、城乡差距与文化冲突的深层剖析 Growing Up as a Rural Child Amidst Disruptions: A Deep Analysis of Economic Reform, Urban-Rural Disparities, and Cultural Conflicts</h1>

<h2>1. 经济改革的双刃剑：从奇迹到隐形剥夺 The Double-Edged Sword of Economic Reform: From Miracle to Invisible Deprivation</h2>

<p>1998年至2011年，中国的经济改革进入深化阶段，成为全球化时代经济发展的典范。加入WTO后，中国以出口驱动、基础设施建设和开放市场为核心策略，将沿海地区迅速打造为全球供应链的枢纽。工业化的飞速发展推动了中国GDP年均增长率突破10%，跻身全球第二大经济体。这一阶段的经济增长，被广泛誉为“全球化的中国样本”。</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2011, China's economic reform entered a deepening phase, becoming a model of economic development in the era of globalization. After joining the WTO, China adopted export-driven strategies, infrastructure development, and market opening, rapidly transforming coastal regions into hubs of the global supply chain. The rapid industrialization drove China’s GDP growth rate to exceed 10% annually, making it the second-largest economy in the world. This period of economic growth was widely praised as the "Chinese model of globalization."</p>

<p>然而，这场经济奇迹隐藏着深刻的不平等。城乡资源的分配失衡，不仅体现在收入差距，更在于政策导向和资本流动的偏向。农村成为了“供血者”，被动地支持城市的现代化和全球化进程。按照大卫·哈维的资本流动理论，资本天然趋向于高回报的区域。在中国，沿海城市得到了政策倾斜、资本注入和基础设施建设的优先支持，成为外资的首选之地。而农村，尤其是内陆地区，则因回报率低、产业发展滞后，逐渐边缘化。1998年，农村人均可支配收入仅为城市的50%；到2011年，这一比例进一步下降至35%。这种收入剪刀差不仅意味着财富的不平等，还表明农村人群在教育、医疗和社会保障等方面长期被剥夺，形成了全方位的资源失衡。</p>
<p>However, this economic miracle conceals profound inequalities. The imbalance in the allocation of resources between urban and rural areas is reflected not only in income disparities but also in policy direction and capital flow. Rural areas have become the "blood suppliers," passively supporting urbanization and globalization processes. According to David Harvey’s theory of capital flow, capital naturally gravitates toward high-return areas. In China, coastal cities have received preferential policies, capital injections, and infrastructure development, making them the preferred destinations for foreign investment. In contrast, rural areas, especially inland regions, have become marginalized due to low returns and delayed industrial development. In 1998, per capita disposable income in rural areas was only 50% of that in urban areas; by 2011, this ratio further declined to 35%. This income disparity not only signifies wealth inequality but also indicates the long-term deprivation of rural populations in areas such as education, healthcare, and social security, resulting in an all-encompassing resource imbalance.</p>

<p>城乡发展的不对称，形成了一种“汲取式”资源转移模式。农村提供了土地、劳动力和基础资源，但这些资源的利用回报却被城市吸纳，农村没有形成产业积累或经济反哺机制。超过2亿农民工流入城市，为制造业、建筑业和服务业提供廉价劳动力。然而，由于户籍制度限制，这些劳动力被排除在城市公共服务体系之外。他们不仅无法享受与城市居民同等的社会保障，还要承担高昂的住房、教育等生活成本。农村劳动力外流，使农业劳动力逐步老龄化，农村经济陷入低水平生产的循环。与此同时，土地被用于城市扩张和工业园区建设，农民的土地权益受到压缩。任何经济模式的收益增长，必然伴随成本的再分配。中国的城市化和工业化，把隐形成本转嫁到了农村家庭和儿童身上。农民工外出务工导致大量留守儿童的出现。据统计，2010年中国有超过6000万留守儿童，他们不仅缺乏父母的情感陪伴，还承担了远超年龄负担的家庭责任。留守儿童因教育资源匮乏和社会资本缺失，在职业选择和社会流动中处于显著劣势。它们的成长代价成为城市经济发展的“隐形成本”，也为未来的代际贫困埋下了伏笔。</p>
<p>The asymmetry in urban-rural development has formed a “drainage-type” resource transfer model. Rural areas provide land, labor, and basic resources, but the returns from utilizing these resources are absorbed by cities, leaving rural areas without industrial accumulation or economic self-support mechanisms. Over 200 million migrant workers have moved to cities, providing cheap labor for manufacturing, construction, and service industries. However, due to the household registration system, these laborers are excluded from the urban public service system. They not only cannot enjoy the same social security as urban residents but also face high living costs in housing, education, and other areas. The outflow of rural labor forces has led to the aging of agricultural labor and caused the rural economy to fall into a cycle of low-level production. Meanwhile, land is being used for urban expansion and industrial park construction, compressing the land rights of farmers. The increase in the benefits of any economic model must be accompanied by a redistribution of costs. China’s urbanization and industrialization have shifted invisible costs onto rural families and children. The migrant workers' departure has led to the appearance of a large number of left-behind children. According to statistics, in 2010, China had over 60 million left-behind children, who not only lack emotional companionship from their parents but also bear family responsibilities far beyond their age. Due to the lack of educational resources and social capital, these children are at a significant disadvantage in career choices and social mobility. The costs of their growth have become the “invisible costs” of urban economic development, setting the stage for future intergenerational poverty.</p>

<h1>My Experience: The Personal Pain of the Economic Scissors Gap</h1>

<p>我出生于湖南乡村，这片土地是中国经济增长体系中的边缘地带。尽管我的父母没有选择外出务工，而是将我寄养在外公外婆家，我的成长依然深刻地被城乡差距的裂痕所影响。我的故事，既是个体的经历，也是那个时代无数农村家庭共同命运的缩影。</p>
<p>I was born in a rural area in Hunan, which is on the margins of China's economic growth system. Although my parents did not choose to work outside the home and instead sent me to live with my grandparents, my growth was still deeply affected by the cracks caused by the urban-rural divide. My story is both a personal experience and a reflection of the shared fate of countless rural families during that time.</p>

<p>我的父母没有像许多家庭那样外出务工，而是将我寄养在外公外婆的家中。这种安排尽管避免了亲子关系的完全断裂，但依然带来了情感上的疏离。外公外婆的陪伴弥补了父母情感的缺席，他们的关爱为我提供了成长中难得的温暖。然而，寄养生活同时也意味着情感的分裂——我在亲密关系中被动接受安排，却对父母产生了距离感。他们的选择让我意识到家庭经济压力的存在，但也让我感受到一种被疏忽的孤独。外公外婆以他们传统、质朴的方式照顾我，但他们的教育模式与现代学校教育的要求之间存在断层。我感受到一种情感上的依赖，却无法从中获取对未来社会竞争力的帮助。与之相对，我的父母承担起家庭经济的主要压力，但他们在情感支持和教育引导上的缺位，让这种成长充满矛盾。</p>
<p>My parents did not follow the common trend of working outside the home but instead sent me to live with my grandparents. This arrangement, while avoiding a complete rupture in the parent-child relationship, still led to emotional alienation. My grandparents' companionship filled the emotional void left by my parents, and their love provided me with rare warmth during my growth. However, living with my grandparents also meant emotional division—passively accepting the arrangement in intimate relationships, I developed a sense of distance from my parents. Their choice made me realize the economic pressure on the family, but it also made me feel a neglected loneliness. My grandparents cared for me in their traditional, simple way, but their educational approach created a gap between their methods and the demands of modern school education. I felt emotional dependence but was unable to gain the competitive advantage necessary for the future society. In contrast, my parents shouldered the main economic pressure for the family, but their absence in providing emotional support and educational guidance made this growth process filled with contradictions.</p>

<p>从小生活在寄养环境中，我被迫更早地承担责任。这种环境教会我独立，但也让我过早地感受到压力。由于父母的经济状况有限，我学会了节俭与责任。我知道每一笔开支都代表了家庭的负担，因此，我早早意识到，只有通过优异的学业表现才能证明自己的价值，改变未来的命运。在寄养环境中，我常常被迫面对乡村社会的议论。他们对寄养儿童的标签化认知，以及对家庭背景的好奇，使我更早地学会隐藏脆弱。这种经验让我形成了强烈的自我要求，但也让我对外界的评价格外敏感。</p>
<p>Growing up in a foster care environment, I was forced to take on responsibilities earlier. This environment taught me independence, but it also made me feel pressure prematurely. Due to my parents' limited economic situation, I learned to be frugal and responsible. I knew every expenditure represented a family burden, so I realized early on that only by excelling academically could I prove my worth and change my future. In the foster care environment, I was often forced to face the village society's gossip. Their stereotypical views of foster children and curiosity about my family background made me learn to hide my vulnerability. This experience made me form strong self-expectations but also made me overly sensitive to external evaluations.</p>

<p>乡村的教育资源短缺让我从一开始就站在了不平等的起跑线上。尽管我的寄养生活为我提供了一定的情感支持，但教育资源的匮乏却是我无法回避的现实。我的村小仅有几名教师，同时教授多门学科。教学资源的贫乏和课程的单一，让我的学习体验极为有限。实验室、图书馆、课外活动，这些在城市学校看似平常的设施，对我们来说几乎是无法想象的奢侈。乡村学校的教学质量，直接影响了学生在升学中的竞争力。尽管我凭借自己的努力进入了城市的重点中学，但城乡资源的不平等，尤其是语言、生活习惯和文化背景的差异，让我感受到一种无形的“圈层排斥”。</p>
<p>The shortage of educational resources in rural areas placed me at an unequal starting point from the beginning. Although my foster care life provided me with some emotional support, the lack of educational resources was an unavoidable reality. My village school had only a few teachers, who taught multiple subjects. The lack of teaching resources and the narrow curriculum severely limited my learning experience. Laboratories, libraries, and extracurricular activities—facilities that seemed ordinary in urban schools—were almost unimaginable luxuries for us. The quality of teaching in rural schools directly impacted students' competitiveness in further education. Although I entered a key city high school through my efforts, the unequal distribution of resources between urban and rural areas, especially differences in language, lifestyle, and cultural background, made me feel an invisible "social exclusion." </p>

<p>我的寄养生活虽然不同于典型的“留守儿童”经历，但我目睹了周围许多家庭的父母外出务工，他们的孩子因父母的离开而成为真正的“留守儿童”。农民工为城市贡献了廉价劳动力，但却因户籍制度被排除在城市的福利和公共服务之外。他们的收入常常难以支撑家庭的长远利益，孩子的教育和成长需求得不到满足。研究显示，留守儿童更易产生情感缺失、学业压力大和社会适应困难等问题。我目睹了许多留守儿童因缺乏父母的陪伴和指导而在成长中遭遇挫折，甚至陷入犯罪或心理问题的困境。城乡户籍制度和教育资源分配的不均衡，让乡村成为城市经济发展的“供血者”。父母外出务工的经济收益有限，而农村家庭和儿童却承担了情感缺失和机会不均的长期代价。</p>
<p>Although my foster care life was different from the typical "left-behind children" experience, I witnessed many families around me where parents worked outside the home, and their children became true "left-behind children" due to their parents' absence. Migrant workers contribute cheap labor to cities but are excluded from the benefits and public services of urban areas due to the household registration system. Their income is often insufficient to support the long-term interests of the family, and the educational and developmental needs of their children are unmet. Research shows that left-behind children are more likely to experience emotional deprivation, academic pressure, and social adaptation difficulties. I witnessed many left-behind children who, due to the lack of parental companionship and guidance, encountered setbacks in their growth and even fell into crime or psychological problems. The unequal urban-rural household registration system and the uneven distribution of educational resources have turned rural areas into "blood suppliers" for urban economic development. The economic gains from parents working outside are limited, yet rural families and children bear the long-term costs of emotional deprivation and unequal opportunities.</p>

<p>当我进入城市重点中学后，口音、行为和生活习惯的差异让我难以融入。这种城乡文化的冲突让我明白，城乡差距不仅是资源的不平等，更是文化的边界。寄养经历让我从小意识到，个人努力难以完全对抗制度性的屏障。教育资源的不平等、城乡社会资本的差异，以及经济剪刀差的固化，让个体奋斗显得微不足道。这种认识驱使我更加努力，但也让我对社会的不公平深感无力。</p>
<p>When I entered a key city high school, the differences in accent, behavior, and lifestyle made it difficult for me to integrate. This urban-rural cultural conflict made me realize that the urban-rural gap is not only an inequality in resources but also a cultural boundary. My foster care experience made me realize early on that individual effort cannot fully overcome institutional barriers. The inequality of educational resources, the differences in social capital between urban and rural areas, and the entrenchment of the economic scissors gap made individual struggle seem insignificant. This realization drove me to work even harder, but it also made me deeply powerless against the social injustice.</p>

<h1>Rural Labor Migration: The "Alienation" of the Lewis Model</h1>

<p>根据刘易斯二元经济模型，农村剩余劳动力的转移被认为是推动经济现代化的重要路径。然而在中国，这一理论在实践中呈现出“异化”的特征，农村劳动力不仅被作为经济发展的工具，还因制度和文化结构的压迫，遭遇多重剥夺。</p>
<p>According to the Lewis dual economy model, the transfer of surplus rural labor is considered an important path to economic modernization. However, in China, this theory shows an "alienated" characteristic in practice. Rural labor is not only used as a tool for economic development but also faces multiple deprivations due to systemic and cultural structures.</p>

<p>中国的城市化和工业化高度依赖于2.2亿农民工的廉价劳动。尽管这些流动人口支撑了国家经济奇迹，但他们自身及其家庭却被排除在经济红利的分享之外。农民工在城市中面临着教育、医疗、住房等基本公共服务的缺失。例如，2010年，70%的农民工家庭无法在城市落户，其随迁子女大多只能进入低质量的农民工子弟学校就读。这种社会排斥不仅抑制了农民工的城市化进程，也在代际之间延续了贫困和不平等。农民工的收入表面上缓解了农村家庭的经济困境，但高额城市生活成本将大部分收益重新吸入资本市场。例如，城市房租、教育费用、生活开销等，将农民工积累的微薄财富迅速消耗殆尽。这种“抽血式”模式使农民工难以通过劳动实现社会流动。</p>
<p>China’s urbanization and industrialization heavily rely on the cheap labor of 220 million migrant workers. Although these migrant workers support the country’s economic miracle, they and their families are excluded from sharing the economic dividends. Migrant workers face a lack of basic public services such as education, healthcare, and housing in cities. For example, in 2010, 70% of migrant worker families were unable to settle in cities, and their children could mostly only attend low-quality migrant children’s schools. This social exclusion not only hinders the urbanization process of migrant workers but also perpetuates poverty and inequality across generations. While migrant workers' income seemingly alleviates the economic difficulties of rural families, the high cost of urban living rapidly consumes most of their earnings. For example, urban rent, education fees, and living expenses quickly deplete the meager wealth that migrant workers accumulate. This "blood-draining" model makes it difficult for migrant workers to achieve social mobility through labor.</p>

<p>农村劳动力的大规模迁徙，不仅带来了经济上的负担，还导致家庭结构和情感支持体系的破裂。农民工的务工收入常常用于家庭的生计和子女教育，但这种收入模式往往无法形成稳定的经济积累。随着子女的成长，家庭在教育、婚嫁等方面的支出加剧，农民工家庭难以摆脱“月光”的循环困境。劳动力的城市迁移，未能真正改善农村家庭的生活条件，而只是维持了基本生存。大量的劳动力输出，没有反哺农村，反而进一步削弱了农村经济和社会活力。父母的长期离乡导致留守儿童缺乏亲密的家庭关系，形成情感上的孤独感。他们常常缺乏陪伴与引导，在心理健康和社会适应上面临重大挑战。留守儿童的学业表现普遍低于城市儿童。由于父母缺席，祖辈监护的文化与教育水平有限，导致这些孩子在教育资源上进一步处于劣势。他们中的许多人在成年后延续了父母的务工模式，难以通过教育和职业突破代际贫困。</p>
<p>The large-scale migration of rural labor not only brings economic burdens but also leads to the breakdown of family structure and emotional support systems. The income from migrant workers’ jobs is often used for the family’s livelihood and children’s education, but this income model often fails to create stable economic accumulation. As children grow up, family expenditures on education and marriage increase, and migrant worker families find it difficult to escape the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. The migration of labor to cities has not truly improved the living conditions of rural families but only maintained basic survival. A large amount of labor output has not fed back into the rural areas but has further weakened the rural economy and social vitality. The long-term absence of parents has caused left-behind children to lack close family relationships, leading to emotional loneliness. They often lack companionship and guidance, facing significant challenges in mental health and social adaptation. Left-behind children’s academic performance is generally lower than that of urban children. Due to the absence of parents and the limited cultural and educational level of grandparents, these children are further disadvantaged in terms of educational resources. Many of them continue their parents' pattern of working away from home as adults and struggle to break the intergenerational poverty through education and career advancement.</p>

<p>布迪厄的社会资本理论为理解劳动力迁移中的城乡困境提供了重要视角。社会资本不仅包括经济资源，还涵盖文化、教育和社会网络的积累。在中国的劳动力转移中，农村家庭因缺乏社会资本而进一步被边缘化。城市对农民工的需求是单一的劳动力需求，而非对其社会资本的吸纳。农民工在城市中面临严重的文化排斥。他们的生活方式、语言习惯、社会交往网络难以融入城市主流社会，这种边缘化进一步加剧了身份认同的危机。农民工子女在教育上的劣势并非仅仅因资源短缺，还体现在社会资本的缺失。他们缺乏能够将教育成果转化为社会机会的支持体系。即使完成学业，社会网络的缺失仍限制了他们的职业发展和社会流动。劳动力迁移不仅带来了经济成果的不平等，还导致了农村社会资本的流失。农村社区因劳动力输出，逐渐失去了维系社会活力的年轻一代，这种“抽血式”迁移使农村进一步陷入资源枯竭。</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s theory of social capital provides an important perspective for understanding the urban-rural dilemmas in labor migration. Social capital not only includes economic resources but also encompasses the accumulation of culture, education, and social networks. In China’s labor transfer, rural families are further marginalized due to their lack of social capital. The urban demand for migrant workers is a single labor demand, rather than an absorption of their social capital. Migrant workers face severe cultural exclusion in cities. Their lifestyles, language habits, and social networks have difficulty integrating into the mainstream urban society, and this marginalization further exacerbates the crisis of identity. The disadvantage of migrant workers’ children in education is not just due to a shortage of resources, but also due to the lack of social capital. They lack the support systems that can translate educational achievements into social opportunities. Even if they complete their studies, the absence of social networks still limits their career development and social mobility. Labor migration has not only resulted in unequal economic outcomes but has also led to the loss of rural social capital. Rural communities, due to labor outflow, have gradually lost the younger generation that sustains social vitality, and this "blood-draining" migration has further plunged rural areas into resource depletion.</p>

<p>中国农村劳动力的迁移，是经济奇迹背后隐含的牺牲。刘易斯模型中描绘的“现代化”蓝图在现实中异化为工具化的劳动力利用。要实现城乡平等，必须从制度、文化和资本分配上重新设计，赋予迁徙者更多的尊严和机会。唯有如此，这场以牺牲为代价的迁徙才能被视为真正的进步。</p>
<p>The migration of rural labor in China is the hidden sacrifice behind the economic miracle. The "modernization" blueprint depicted in the Lewis model has been alienated into the instrumental use of labor. To achieve urban-rural equality, it is necessary to redesign the system, culture, and capital distribution, and provide migrants with more dignity and opportunities. Only by doing so can this migration, which has been achieved at the cost of sacrifice, be seen as true progress.</p>


<h1>Education: Path Dependency from Hope to Dilemma</h1>

<p>教育在社会流动和经济发展的作用上被赋予了极高的期望。然而，从1998年的高校扩招到城乡教育资源的不均衡分配，教育改革在释放希望的同时也制造了新的困境。对于农村学生来说，教育改革的路径依赖性更加凸显：在政策的愿景与现实的鸿沟之间，他们的上升之路被内卷化、资源壁垒和文化冲突所阻碍。</p>

<p>Education has been given high expectations for its role in social mobility and economic development. However, from the expansion of higher education in 1998 to the uneven distribution of educational resources between urban and rural areas, educational reforms have created new dilemmas while releasing hope. For rural students, the path dependency of education reform is even more evident: between the gap between the policy vision and reality, their upward mobility is hindered by internal competition, resource barriers, and cultural conflicts.</p>

<p>1998年的高校扩招，标志着中国高等教育从“精英化”向“大众化”转型。这一政策的初衷在于为经济转型培养高素质劳动力。然而，随着高等教育规模的急速扩张，资源不足、质量下滑和就业压力成为不可回避的结果。扩招带来的直接后果是教育资源的摊薄。一些普通高校因扩招缺乏足够的师资力量和基础设施，教学质量难以保障。课程设计更加趋于标准化，削弱了对学生的个性化培养。2010年，全国大学毕业生人数达到620万，比1998年增长了四倍。然而，经济结构的调整未能与这一增长同步，岗位数量有限，导致“毕业即失业”现象突出。特别是农村学生，他们因缺乏社会资本和就业资源的支持，在竞争中处于不利地位。</p>

<p>The expansion of higher education in 1998 marked China's shift from "elite" education to "mass" education. The original intention of this policy was to cultivate high-quality labor for economic transformation. However, with the rapid expansion of higher education, resource shortages, quality decline, and employment pressure became inevitable results. The direct consequence of expansion was the dilution of educational resources. Some ordinary universities lacked sufficient teaching staff and infrastructure, making it difficult to guarantee teaching quality. Course designs became more standardized, weakening the personalized development of students. In 2010, the number of university graduates nationwide reached 6.2 million, a fourfold increase from 1998. However, the adjustment of the economic structure did not keep pace with this growth, and the number of jobs was limited, leading to a prominent "graduation equals unemployment" phenomenon. Particularly for rural students, their lack of social capital and employment resources puts them at a disadvantage in competition.</p>

<p>高校扩招虽表面上为农村学生提供了更多机会，但他们在起点上的劣势和终点上的资源缺乏，让这一机会看似平等却难以实现公平。农村学生通常来自教育资源匮乏的环境，他们在高考竞争中难以与城市学生抗衡。即使进入大学，也因基础知识薄弱和文化适应障碍而难以充分发挥潜力。布迪厄的社会资本理论指出，教育成功不仅依赖于学术能力，还需要文化和社会资源的支持。对于农村学生而言，家庭和社会网络的缺失让他们在职业选择和社会流动中始终处于弱势地位。</p>

<p>Although the expansion of higher education superficially provided more opportunities for rural students, their disadvantages at the starting point and the lack of resources at the endpoint made this opportunity seem equal but difficult to achieve fairness. Rural students usually come from environments with limited educational resources and struggle to compete with urban students in the college entrance examination. Even if they enter university, they often cannot fully realize their potential due to weak foundational knowledge and cultural adaptation difficulties. Bourdieu's theory of social capital points out that educational success depends not only on academic ability but also on cultural and social resources. For rural students, the lack of family and social networks makes them always disadvantaged in career choices and social mobility.</p>

<p>城乡教育资源的不均衡分配，是中国城乡剪刀差的一个核心表现。这种不平等不仅体现在硬件条件上，还反映在教育理念、文化认同和学生成长环境的差异中。我所就读的乡村小学教学条件极其简陋，教师需要兼任多门学科，教学方法单一。实验设备、图书馆和课外活动等在乡村学校几乎不存在，学生的学习以“填鸭式”教育为主。这种教育环境限制了学生的想象力和批判性思维的发展。尽管义务教育政策覆盖了绝大部分农村地区，但财政支持和执行力度不足。农村学校的经费严重依赖地方政府，而欠发达地区财政能力有限，导致学校发展滞后。</p>

<p>The uneven distribution of educational resources between urban and rural areas is a core manifestation of the urban-rural disparity in China. This inequality is not only reflected in hardware conditions but also in differences in educational philosophy, cultural identity, and students' growth environments. The rural primary school I attended had extremely poor teaching conditions, with teachers required to teach multiple subjects and a limited variety of teaching methods. There were almost no laboratory equipment, libraries, or extracurricular activities in rural schools, and students' learning was mostly based on rote memorization. This educational environment limited the development of students' imagination and critical thinking. Although the compulsory education policy covers most rural areas, financial support and enforcement are insufficient. Rural schools' funding heavily depends on local governments, and underdeveloped regions' limited fiscal capacity has led to slow school development.</p>

<p>城市学校则因政策倾斜和社会资本的集聚，形成了资源优势的垄断。城市重点学校拥有先进的教学设备、优秀的师资力量以及丰富的课外活动和国际化视野。这些条件不仅拓宽了学生的知识面，也为他们提供了更广阔的成长机会。当我转入城市重点学校后，第一次接触到现代化的教学环境。然而，我的乡村背景成为隐形的身份壁垒：口音、生活习惯、社交方式都让我显得格格不入。即使成绩优秀，我依然难以融入城市学生的圈层，这种排斥感进一步强化了城乡教育的不平等。</p>

<p>Urban schools, due to policy preferences and the concentration of social capital, have monopolized the advantage of resources. Key urban schools have advanced teaching equipment, excellent faculty, and a rich variety of extracurricular activities and international perspectives. These conditions not only broaden students' knowledge but also provide them with broader growth opportunities. When I transferred to a key urban school, I was exposed to a modern teaching environment for the first time. However, my rural background became an invisible identity barrier: my accent, habits, and social interactions made me feel out of place. Even with excellent grades, I still found it difficult to integrate into the social circles of urban students, and this sense of exclusion further reinforced the inequality in urban-rural education.</p>

<p>高校扩招的初衷是通过扩大教育覆盖面，为农村学生提供更多社会流动的机会。然而，这一政策忽视了城乡学生在资源和文化资本上的不对等，使得表面上的公平反而加剧了隐形的不平等。农村学生从义务教育开始就面临资源短缺的问题，在高考这一竞争平台上很难与城市学生抗衡。即使进入大学，他们在语言、知识广度和社会经验上也难以适应城市化的教育模式。农村学生通过高等教育获得的学历，其在社会流动中的作用逐渐减弱。就业市场的内卷化，让学历竞争更加白热化，而农村学生缺乏城市同龄人拥有的职业指导和社会关系，在就业竞争中处于明显劣势。</p>

<p>The original intention of the expansion of higher education was to broaden the coverage of education and provide more opportunities for social mobility for rural students. However, this policy ignored the imbalance in resources and cultural capital between urban and rural students, which made the apparent fairness exacerbate hidden inequality. Rural students have faced resource shortages since compulsory education and find it difficult to compete with urban students on the platform of the college entrance examination. Even if they enter university, they still struggle to adapt to the urbanized educational model due to language barriers, limited knowledge breadth, and lack of social experience. The degree obtained through higher education gradually loses its role in social mobility. The intense competition in the job market makes the competition for educational qualifications more fierce, while rural students lack career guidance and social connections that urban peers have, putting them at a clear disadvantage in the job market.</p>

<p>高校扩招虽然使入学率提升，但对农村学生的支持力度不足。奖学金和助学贷款等扶持政策覆盖面有限，农村学生的经济压力未能得到有效缓解。城市学校资源集中的现状，使得优质教育资源难以向农村地区扩散。即使有少量农村学生进入重点高校，他们也因文化适应障碍而难以充分发挥潜力。高校扩招曾为无数农村学生打开希望的大门，但资源分配的失衡和社会资本的缺失让这一希望在现实中显得虚幻而沉重。修复城乡教育的裂痕，不仅需要政策上的精准设计，更需要社会结构的全面变革。只有当每一个孩子都能在平等的土壤中成长，教育才真正成为改变命运的钥匙，而非延续不平等的工具。</p>

<p>Although the expansion of higher education has increased enrollment, the support for rural students has been insufficient. Support policies such as scholarships and student loans have limited coverage, and rural students' economic pressures have not been effectively alleviated. The concentration of resources in urban schools makes it difficult for quality educational resources to spread to rural areas. Even if a small number of rural students enter key universities, they still find it difficult to fully realize their potential due to cultural adaptation challenges. The expansion of higher education once opened doors of hope for countless rural students, but the imbalance in resource distribution and the lack of social capital made this hope seem elusive and burdensome in reality. To repair the urban-rural educational divide, not only precise policy design is needed, but also a comprehensive transformation of the social structure. Only when every child can grow up in equal soil can education truly become the key to changing their destiny, rather than a tool for perpetuating inequality.</p>


  <h1>Factory Experience: Alienation of Labor and Social Marginalization</h1>

<p>在16岁时，我选择休学进入沿海工厂。这段经历让我第一次面对工业化对个体的压迫，也让我深刻认识到城乡劳动力迁移与社会结构的不平等。流水线的机械性工作和城市社会的排斥让我体会到，经济增长的奇迹背后隐藏的是个体的工具化与边缘化。</p>

<p>At the age of 16, I chose to leave school and work in a coastal factory. This experience exposed me to the oppressive side of industrialization and made me deeply aware of the inequality in rural-urban labor migration and social structures. The mechanized work on the assembly line and the social exclusion in the city made me realize that behind the economic growth miracle lies the toolification and marginalization of individuals.</p>

<p>在流水线工作中，每一个动作都被量化，每一分每一秒都严格按照生产目标规划。劳动不再是表达创造力或体现自我价值的方式，而仅仅是满足生产需求的手段。马克思的劳动异化理论指出，当劳动者无法控制劳动成果时，他们会感到与劳动本身、劳动过程甚至劳动环境的疏离。这正是我在工厂流水线上的切身感受：机械化的劳动消除了人与工作的关联性，工作成了一种无意义的重复行为。在工厂中，劳动者被视为可以随时替代的“工具”。工厂管理者更关注效率和产能，而非个体的身心状态。这种对人的工具化利用，让我深刻感受到作为劳动者的无力感与孤立感。</p>

<p>On the assembly line, every action is quantified, and every minute and second is strictly planned according to production goals. Labor is no longer a means of expressing creativity or reflecting one's self-worth; it merely serves to meet production demands. Marx's theory of alienation of labor suggests that when workers cannot control the results of their labor, they feel alienated from the work itself, the process, and even the work environment. This was my personal experience on the factory assembly line: mechanized labor removed the connection between people and work, making the work feel like a meaningless repetitive task. In the factory, workers are seen as interchangeable "tools." Factory managers focus more on efficiency and production capacity rather than the physical and mental well-being of individuals. This toolification of people made me deeply feel the powerlessness and isolation of being a laborer.</p>

<p>在工厂之外，农民工群体面临的社会排斥感更加明显。作为一名年轻的农村女孩，我发现无论是工厂内部还是城市生活中，农民工始终被贴上“外来者”的标签。中国的户籍制度将农民工与城市福利体系隔离开来。尽管农民工为城市经济的运转提供了不可或缺的劳动力，但他们无法享受与城市居民等同的教育、医疗和住房福利。这种制度性排斥让农民工群体始终停留在“边缘阶层”。布迪厄的社会资本理论认为，社会资本的缺乏会限制个体的社会流动。农民工群体在城市中缺乏稳定的社会关系和文化认同，这种“文化孤岛”状态进一步加剧了城乡身份的断裂。</p>

<p>Beyond the factory, the social exclusion faced by migrant workers is even more evident. As a young rural girl, I found that whether inside the factory or in city life, migrant workers are always labeled as "outsiders." China's household registration system separates migrant workers from the urban welfare system. Although migrant workers provide essential labor for the operation of the urban economy, they cannot enjoy the same educational, healthcare, and housing benefits as urban residents. This institutional exclusion keeps migrant workers in a "marginal class." Bourdieu's theory of social capital suggests that the lack of social capital limits individual social mobility. Migrant workers in cities lack stable social relationships and cultural identity, and this "cultural isolation" further deepens the rupture of urban-rural identities.</p>

<p>户籍制度是农民工边缘化的核心制度性障碍。这一制度将城市和农村分割为两个完全不同的社会体系，使农民工成为“经济贡献者”而非“社会成员”。农民工子女在城市难以进入公立学校，只能选择教育质量较差的农民工子弟学校。这种教育壁垒让代际贫困循环得以延续。农民工群体长期缺乏医疗保险和社会保障，养老和疾病风险完全由个体和家庭承担。数据显示，截至2010年，超过70%的农民工没有签订正式劳动合同，劳动权益得不到保护。</p>

<p>The household registration system is the core institutional barrier to the marginalization of migrant workers. This system divides urban and rural areas into two completely different social systems, making migrant workers "economic contributors" rather than "social members." The children of migrant workers find it difficult to enter public schools in the city and can only attend migrant workers' schools with lower educational quality. This educational barrier perpetuates the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Migrant workers have long lacked health insurance and social security, and the risks of aging and illness are entirely borne by individuals and families. Statistics show that by 2010, more than 70% of migrant workers had not signed formal labor contracts, and their labor rights were not protected.</p>

<p>尽管中国出台了一系列劳动保护法律，但对农民工的覆盖和执行力度不足。工厂中的农民工通常没有固定劳动合同，工资结算和工作条件缺乏法律保障。加班文化、工资拖欠和工伤风险是农民工的普遍问题。农民工家庭收入的很大一部分通过高额房租、食品价格和城市生活成本重新回流到资本市场。尽管看似提高了生活水平，但家庭财富积累的可能性被大大削弱。</p>

<p>Although China has introduced a series of labor protection laws, the coverage and enforcement for migrant workers are insufficient. Migrant workers in factories typically do not have fixed labor contracts, and wage settlement and working conditions lack legal protection. Overtime culture, wage arrears, and the risk of workplace injuries are common issues for migrant workers. A large portion of migrant workers' family income is reinvested into the capital market through high rents, food prices, and the cost of urban living. Although this seemingly improves their living standards, the possibility of wealth accumulation for these families is significantly weakened.</p>

<p>个体的视角：从流水线到社会边缘</p>

<p>The individual perspective: From the assembly line to social marginalization</p>

<p>流水线上的生活让我意识到，工业化虽然提升了经济效率，却以牺牲个体价值为代价。每天重复机械的动作，让我感到自己成为一台机器的组成部分，失去了对工作的主导权和劳动成果的归属感。作为一名农村女孩，我既不属于工厂内部的核心管理群体，也无法融入城市社会的主流文化。这种身份上的边缘化，让我深刻认识到农村与城市之间不仅有经济上的差距，还有文化与社会资本的深层鸿沟。</p>

<p>Life on the assembly line made me realize that while industrialization increases economic efficiency, it comes at the cost of individual value. Repeating mechanical actions every day made me feel like a part of a machine, losing my control over work and the sense of ownership of my labor results. As a rural girl, I neither belonged to the core management group within the factory nor could I integrate into the mainstream culture of urban society. This marginalization of identity made me deeply realize that the gap between rural and urban areas is not only economic but also includes profound cultural and social capital divides.</p>

<p>我的工厂经历是中国工业化进程中数百万农民工生活的缩影。流水线的异化劳动不仅剥夺了个体对劳动的控制，也凸显了城乡劳动力迁移过程中制度设计的不足。要真正实现包容性发展，中国需要在政策和社会层面打破劳动者的边缘化境遇，让每一位参与经济建设的个体都能享有尊严与公平的权益。</p>

<p>My factory experience is a microcosm of the lives of millions of migrant workers in China's industrialization process. The alienation of labor on the assembly line not only deprived individuals of control over their work but also highlighted the inadequacies in the design of systems for rural-urban labor migration. To truly achieve inclusive development, China needs to break the marginalized status of laborers at both the policy and social levels, ensuring that every individual participating in economic development can enjoy dignity and fair rights.</p>
