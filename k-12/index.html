<h1> Growing Up as a Rural Child Amidst Disruptions: A Deep Analysis of Economic Reform, Urban-Rural Disparities, and Cultural Conflicts</h1>

<h2>1. 经济改革的双刃剑：从奇迹到隐形剥夺 The Double-Edged Sword of Economic Reform: From Miracle to Invisible Deprivation</h2>

<p>1998年至2011年，中国的经济改革进入深化阶段，成为全球化时代经济发展的典范。加入WTO后，中国以出口驱动、基础设施建设和开放市场为核心策略，将沿海地区迅速打造为全球供应链的枢纽。工业化的飞速发展推动了中国GDP年均增长率突破10%，跻身全球第二大经济体。这一阶段的经济增长，被广泛誉为“全球化的中国样本”。</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2011, China's economic reform entered a deepening phase, becoming a model of economic development in the era of globalization. After joining the WTO, China adopted export-driven strategies, infrastructure development, and market opening, rapidly transforming coastal regions into hubs of the global supply chain. The rapid industrialization drove China’s GDP growth rate to exceed 10% annually, making it the second-largest economy in the world. This period of economic growth was widely praised as the "Chinese model of globalization."</p>

<p>然而，这场经济奇迹隐藏着深刻的不平等。城乡资源的分配失衡，不仅体现在收入差距，更在于政策导向和资本流动的偏向。农村成为了“供血者”，被动地支持城市的现代化和全球化进程。按照大卫·哈维的资本流动理论，资本天然趋向于高回报的区域。在中国，沿海城市得到了政策倾斜、资本注入和基础设施建设的优先支持，成为外资的首选之地。而农村，尤其是内陆地区，则因回报率低、产业发展滞后，逐渐边缘化。1998年，农村人均可支配收入仅为城市的50%；到2011年，这一比例进一步下降至35%。这种收入剪刀差不仅意味着财富的不平等，还表明农村人群在教育、医疗和社会保障等方面长期被剥夺，形成了全方位的资源失衡。</p>
<p>However, this economic miracle conceals profound inequalities. The imbalance in the allocation of resources between urban and rural areas is reflected not only in income disparities but also in policy direction and capital flow. Rural areas have become the "blood suppliers," passively supporting urbanization and globalization processes. According to David Harvey’s theory of capital flow, capital naturally gravitates toward high-return areas. In China, coastal cities have received preferential policies, capital injections, and infrastructure development, making them the preferred destinations for foreign investment. In contrast, rural areas, especially inland regions, have become marginalized due to low returns and delayed industrial development. In 1998, per capita disposable income in rural areas was only 50% of that in urban areas; by 2011, this ratio further declined to 35%. This income disparity not only signifies wealth inequality but also indicates the long-term deprivation of rural populations in areas such as education, healthcare, and social security, resulting in an all-encompassing resource imbalance.</p>

<p>城乡发展的不对称，形成了一种“汲取式”资源转移模式。农村提供了土地、劳动力和基础资源，但这些资源的利用回报却被城市吸纳，农村没有形成产业积累或经济反哺机制。超过2亿农民工流入城市，为制造业、建筑业和服务业提供廉价劳动力。然而，由于户籍制度限制，这些劳动力被排除在城市公共服务体系之外。他们不仅无法享受与城市居民同等的社会保障，还要承担高昂的住房、教育等生活成本。农村劳动力外流，使农业劳动力逐步老龄化，农村经济陷入低水平生产的循环。与此同时，土地被用于城市扩张和工业园区建设，农民的土地权益受到压缩。任何经济模式的收益增长，必然伴随成本的再分配。中国的城市化和工业化，把隐形成本转嫁到了农村家庭和儿童身上。农民工外出务工导致大量留守儿童的出现。据统计，2010年中国有超过6000万留守儿童，他们不仅缺乏父母的情感陪伴，还承担了远超年龄负担的家庭责任。留守儿童因教育资源匮乏和社会资本缺失，在职业选择和社会流动中处于显著劣势。它们的成长代价成为城市经济发展的“隐形成本”，也为未来的代际贫困埋下了伏笔。</p>
<p>The asymmetry in urban-rural development has formed a “drainage-type” resource transfer model. Rural areas provide land, labor, and basic resources, but the returns from utilizing these resources are absorbed by cities, leaving rural areas without industrial accumulation or economic self-support mechanisms. Over 200 million migrant workers have moved to cities, providing cheap labor for manufacturing, construction, and service industries. However, due to the household registration system, these laborers are excluded from the urban public service system. They not only cannot enjoy the same social security as urban residents but also face high living costs in housing, education, and other areas. The outflow of rural labor forces has led to the aging of agricultural labor and caused the rural economy to fall into a cycle of low-level production. Meanwhile, land is being used for urban expansion and industrial park construction, compressing the land rights of farmers. The increase in the benefits of any economic model must be accompanied by a redistribution of costs. China’s urbanization and industrialization have shifted invisible costs onto rural families and children. The migrant workers' departure has led to the appearance of a large number of left-behind children. According to statistics, in 2010, China had over 60 million left-behind children, who not only lack emotional companionship from their parents but also bear family responsibilities far beyond their age. Due to the lack of educational resources and social capital, these children are at a significant disadvantage in career choices and social mobility. The costs of their growth have become the “invisible costs” of urban economic development, setting the stage for future intergenerational poverty.</p>

<h1>My Experience: The Personal Pain of the Economic Scissors Gap</h1>

<p>我出生于湖南乡村，这片土地是中国经济增长体系中的边缘地带。尽管我的父母没有选择外出务工，而是将我寄养在外公外婆家，我的成长依然深刻地被城乡差距的裂痕所影响。我的故事，既是个体的经历，也是那个时代无数农村家庭共同命运的缩影。</p>
<p>I was born in a rural area in Hunan, which is on the margins of China's economic growth system. Although my parents did not choose to work outside the home and instead sent me to live with my grandparents, my growth was still deeply affected by the cracks caused by the urban-rural divide. My story is both a personal experience and a reflection of the shared fate of countless rural families during that time.</p>

<p>我的父母没有像许多家庭那样外出务工，而是将我寄养在外公外婆的家中。这种安排尽管避免了亲子关系的完全断裂，但依然带来了情感上的疏离。外公外婆的陪伴弥补了父母情感的缺席，他们的关爱为我提供了成长中难得的温暖。然而，寄养生活同时也意味着情感的分裂——我在亲密关系中被动接受安排，却对父母产生了距离感。他们的选择让我意识到家庭经济压力的存在，但也让我感受到一种被疏忽的孤独。外公外婆以他们传统、质朴的方式照顾我，但他们的教育模式与现代学校教育的要求之间存在断层。我感受到一种情感上的依赖，却无法从中获取对未来社会竞争力的帮助。与之相对，我的父母承担起家庭经济的主要压力，但他们在情感支持和教育引导上的缺位，让这种成长充满矛盾。</p>
<p>My parents did not follow the common trend of working outside the home but instead sent me to live with my grandparents. This arrangement, while avoiding a complete rupture in the parent-child relationship, still led to emotional alienation. My grandparents' companionship filled the emotional void left by my parents, and their love provided me with rare warmth during my growth. However, living with my grandparents also meant emotional division—passively accepting the arrangement in intimate relationships, I developed a sense of distance from my parents. Their choice made me realize the economic pressure on the family, but it also made me feel a neglected loneliness. My grandparents cared for me in their traditional, simple way, but their educational approach created a gap between their methods and the demands of modern school education. I felt emotional dependence but was unable to gain the competitive advantage necessary for the future society. In contrast, my parents shouldered the main economic pressure for the family, but their absence in providing emotional support and educational guidance made this growth process filled with contradictions.</p>

<p>从小生活在寄养环境中，我被迫更早地承担责任。这种环境教会我独立，但也让我过早地感受到压力。由于父母的经济状况有限，我学会了节俭与责任。我知道每一笔开支都代表了家庭的负担，因此，我早早意识到，只有通过优异的学业表现才能证明自己的价值，改变未来的命运。在寄养环境中，我常常被迫面对乡村社会的议论。他们对寄养儿童的标签化认知，以及对家庭背景的好奇，使我更早地学会隐藏脆弱。这种经验让我形成了强烈的自我要求，但也让我对外界的评价格外敏感。</p>
<p>Growing up in a foster care environment, I was forced to take on responsibilities earlier. This environment taught me independence, but it also made me feel pressure prematurely. Due to my parents' limited economic situation, I learned to be frugal and responsible. I knew every expenditure represented a family burden, so I realized early on that only by excelling academically could I prove my worth and change my future. In the foster care environment, I was often forced to face the village society's gossip. Their stereotypical views of foster children and curiosity about my family background made me learn to hide my vulnerability. This experience made me form strong self-expectations but also made me overly sensitive to external evaluations.</p>

<p>乡村的教育资源短缺让我从一开始就站在了不平等的起跑线上。尽管我的寄养生活为我提供了一定的情感支持，但教育资源的匮乏却是我无法回避的现实。我的村小仅有几名教师，同时教授多门学科。教学资源的贫乏和课程的单一，让我的学习体验极为有限。实验室、图书馆、课外活动，这些在城市学校看似平常的设施，对我们来说几乎是无法想象的奢侈。乡村学校的教学质量，直接影响了学生在升学中的竞争力。尽管我凭借自己的努力进入了城市的重点中学，但城乡资源的不平等，尤其是语言、生活习惯和文化背景的差异，让我感受到一种无形的“圈层排斥”。</p>
<p>The shortage of educational resources in rural areas placed me at an unequal starting point from the beginning. Although my foster care life provided me with some emotional support, the lack of educational resources was an unavoidable reality. My village school had only a few teachers, who taught multiple subjects. The lack of teaching resources and the narrow curriculum severely limited my learning experience. Laboratories, libraries, and extracurricular activities—facilities that seemed ordinary in urban schools—were almost unimaginable luxuries for us. The quality of teaching in rural schools directly impacted students' competitiveness in further education. Although I entered a key city high school through my efforts, the unequal distribution of resources between urban and rural areas, especially differences in language, lifestyle, and cultural background, made me feel an invisible "social exclusion." </p>

<p>我的寄养生活虽然不同于典型的“留守儿童”经历，但我目睹了周围许多家庭的父母外出务工，他们的孩子因父母的离开而成为真正的“留守儿童”。农民工为城市贡献了廉价劳动力，但却因户籍制度被排除在城市的福利和公共服务之外。他们的收入常常难以支撑家庭的长远利益，孩子的教育和成长需求得不到满足。研究显示，留守儿童更易产生情感缺失、学业压力大和社会适应困难等问题。我目睹了许多留守儿童因缺乏父母的陪伴和指导而在成长中遭遇挫折，甚至陷入犯罪或心理问题的困境。城乡户籍制度和教育资源分配的不均衡，让乡村成为城市经济发展的“供血者”。父母外出务工的经济收益有限，而农村家庭和儿童却承担了情感缺失和机会不均的长期代价。</p>
<p>Although my foster care life was different from the typical "left-behind children" experience, I witnessed many families around me where parents worked outside the home, and their children became true "left-behind children" due to their parents' absence. Migrant workers contribute cheap labor to cities but are excluded from the benefits and public services of urban areas due to the household registration system. Their income is often insufficient to support the long-term interests of the family, and the educational and developmental needs of their children are unmet. Research shows that left-behind children are more likely to experience emotional deprivation, academic pressure, and social adaptation difficulties. I witnessed many left-behind children who, due to the lack of parental companionship and guidance, encountered setbacks in their growth and even fell into crime or psychological problems. The unequal urban-rural household registration system and the uneven distribution of educational resources have turned rural areas into "blood suppliers" for urban economic development. The economic gains from parents working outside are limited, yet rural families and children bear the long-term costs of emotional deprivation and unequal opportunities.</p>

<p>当我进入城市重点中学后，口音、行为和生活习惯的差异让我难以融入。这种城乡文化的冲突让我明白，城乡差距不仅是资源的不平等，更是文化的边界。寄养经历让我从小意识到，个人努力难以完全对抗制度性的屏障。教育资源的不平等、城乡社会资本的差异，以及经济剪刀差的固化，让个体奋斗显得微不足道。这种认识驱使我更加努力，但也让我对社会的不公平深感无力。</p>
<p>When I entered a key city high school, the differences in accent, behavior, and lifestyle made it difficult for me to integrate. This urban-rural cultural conflict made me realize that the urban-rural gap is not only an inequality in resources but also a cultural boundary. My foster care experience made me realize early on that individual effort cannot fully overcome institutional barriers. The inequality of educational resources, the differences in social capital between urban and rural areas, and the entrenchment of the economic scissors gap made individual struggle seem insignificant. This realization drove me to work even harder, but it also made me deeply powerless against the social injustice.</p>

<h1>Rural Labor Migration: The "Alienation" of the Lewis Model</h1>

<p>根据刘易斯二元经济模型，农村剩余劳动力的转移被认为是推动经济现代化的重要路径。然而在中国，这一理论在实践中呈现出“异化”的特征，农村劳动力不仅被作为经济发展的工具，还因制度和文化结构的压迫，遭遇多重剥夺。</p>
<p>According to the Lewis dual economy model, the transfer of surplus rural labor is considered an important path to economic modernization. However, in China, this theory shows an "alienated" characteristic in practice. Rural labor is not only used as a tool for economic development but also faces multiple deprivations due to systemic and cultural structures.</p>

<p>中国的城市化和工业化高度依赖于2.2亿农民工的廉价劳动。尽管这些流动人口支撑了国家经济奇迹，但他们自身及其家庭却被排除在经济红利的分享之外。农民工在城市中面临着教育、医疗、住房等基本公共服务的缺失。例如，2010年，70%的农民工家庭无法在城市落户，其随迁子女大多只能进入低质量的农民工子弟学校就读。这种社会排斥不仅抑制了农民工的城市化进程，也在代际之间延续了贫困和不平等。农民工的收入表面上缓解了农村家庭的经济困境，但高额城市生活成本将大部分收益重新吸入资本市场。例如，城市房租、教育费用、生活开销等，将农民工积累的微薄财富迅速消耗殆尽。这种“抽血式”模式使农民工难以通过劳动实现社会流动。</p>
<p>China’s urbanization and industrialization heavily rely on the cheap labor of 220 million migrant workers. Although these migrant workers support the country’s economic miracle, they and their families are excluded from sharing the economic dividends. Migrant workers face a lack of basic public services such as education, healthcare, and housing in cities. For example, in 2010, 70% of migrant worker families were unable to settle in cities, and their children could mostly only attend low-quality migrant children’s schools. This social exclusion not only hinders the urbanization process of migrant workers but also perpetuates poverty and inequality across generations. While migrant workers' income seemingly alleviates the economic difficulties of rural families, the high cost of urban living rapidly consumes most of their earnings. For example, urban rent, education fees, and living expenses quickly deplete the meager wealth that migrant workers accumulate. This "blood-draining" model makes it difficult for migrant workers to achieve social mobility through labor.</p>

<p>农村劳动力的大规模迁徙，不仅带来了经济上的负担，还导致家庭结构和情感支持体系的破裂。农民工的务工收入常常用于家庭的生计和子女教育，但这种收入模式往往无法形成稳定的经济积累。随着子女的成长，家庭在教育、婚嫁等方面的支出加剧，农民工家庭难以摆脱“月光”的循环困境。劳动力的城市迁移，未能真正改善农村家庭的生活条件，而只是维持了基本生存。大量的劳动力输出，没有反哺农村，反而进一步削弱了农村经济和社会活力。父母的长期离乡导致留守儿童缺乏亲密的家庭关系，形成情感上的孤独感。他们常常缺乏陪伴与引导，在心理健康和社会适应上面临重大挑战。留守儿童的学业表现普遍低于城市儿童。由于父母缺席，祖辈监护的文化与教育水平有限，导致这些孩子在教育资源上进一步处于劣势。他们中的许多人在成年后延续了父母的务工模式，难以通过教育和职业突破代际贫困。</p>
<p>The large-scale migration of rural labor not only brings economic burdens but also leads to the breakdown of family structure and emotional support systems. The income from migrant workers’ jobs is often used for the family’s livelihood and children’s education, but this income model often fails to create stable economic accumulation. As children grow up, family expenditures on education and marriage increase, and migrant worker families find it difficult to escape the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. The migration of labor to cities has not truly improved the living conditions of rural families but only maintained basic survival. A large amount of labor output has not fed back into the rural areas but has further weakened the rural economy and social vitality. The long-term absence of parents has caused left-behind children to lack close family relationships, leading to emotional loneliness. They often lack companionship and guidance, facing significant challenges in mental health and social adaptation. Left-behind children’s academic performance is generally lower than that of urban children. Due to the absence of parents and the limited cultural and educational level of grandparents, these children are further disadvantaged in terms of educational resources. Many of them continue their parents' pattern of working away from home as adults and struggle to break the intergenerational poverty through education and career advancement.</p>

<p>布迪厄的社会资本理论为理解劳动力迁移中的城乡困境提供了重要视角。社会资本不仅包括经济资源，还涵盖文化、教育和社会网络的积累。在中国的劳动力转移中，农村家庭因缺乏社会资本而进一步被边缘化。城市对农民工的需求是单一的劳动力需求，而非对其社会资本的吸纳。农民工在城市中面临严重的文化排斥。他们的生活方式、语言习惯、社会交往网络难以融入城市主流社会，这种边缘化进一步加剧了身份认同的危机。农民工子女在教育上的劣势并非仅仅因资源短缺，还体现在社会资本的缺失。他们缺乏能够将教育成果转化为社会机会的支持体系。即使完成学业，社会网络的缺失仍限制了他们的职业发展和社会流动。劳动力迁移不仅带来了经济成果的不平等，还导致了农村社会资本的流失。农村社区因劳动力输出，逐渐失去了维系社会活力的年轻一代，这种“抽血式”迁移使农村进一步陷入资源枯竭。</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s theory of social capital provides an important perspective for understanding the urban-rural dilemmas in labor migration. Social capital not only includes economic resources but also encompasses the accumulation of culture, education, and social networks. In China’s labor transfer, rural families are further marginalized due to their lack of social capital. The urban demand for migrant workers is a single labor demand, rather than an absorption of their social capital. Migrant workers face severe cultural exclusion in cities. Their lifestyles, language habits, and social networks have difficulty integrating into the mainstream urban society, and this marginalization further exacerbates the crisis of identity. The disadvantage of migrant workers’ children in education is not just due to a shortage of resources, but also due to the lack of social capital. They lack the support systems that can translate educational achievements into social opportunities. Even if they complete their studies, the absence of social networks still limits their career development and social mobility. Labor migration has not only resulted in unequal economic outcomes but has also led to the loss of rural social capital. Rural communities, due to labor outflow, have gradually lost the younger generation that sustains social vitality, and this "blood-draining" migration has further plunged rural areas into resource depletion.</p>

<p>中国农村劳动力的迁移，是经济奇迹背后隐含的牺牲。刘易斯模型中描绘的“现代化”蓝图在现实中异化为工具化的劳动力利用。要实现城乡平等，必须从制度、文化和资本分配上重新设计，赋予迁徙者更多的尊严和机会。唯有如此，这场以牺牲为代价的迁徙才能被视为真正的进步。</p>
<p>The migration of rural labor in China is the hidden sacrifice behind the economic miracle. The "modernization" blueprint depicted in the Lewis model has been alienated into the instrumental use of labor. To achieve urban-rural equality, it is necessary to redesign the system, culture, and capital distribution, and provide migrants with more dignity and opportunities. Only by doing so can this migration, which has been achieved at the cost of sacrifice, be seen as true progress.</p>


<h1>Education: Path Dependency from Hope to Dilemma</h1>

<p>教育在社会流动和经济发展的作用上被赋予了极高的期望。然而，从1998年的高校扩招到城乡教育资源的不均衡分配，教育改革在释放希望的同时也制造了新的困境。对于农村学生来说，教育改革的路径依赖性更加凸显：在政策的愿景与现实的鸿沟之间，他们的上升之路被内卷化、资源壁垒和文化冲突所阻碍。</p>

<p>Education has been given high expectations for its role in social mobility and economic development. However, from the expansion of higher education in 1998 to the uneven distribution of educational resources between urban and rural areas, educational reforms have created new dilemmas while releasing hope. For rural students, the path dependency of education reform is even more evident: between the gap between the policy vision and reality, their upward mobility is hindered by internal competition, resource barriers, and cultural conflicts.</p>

<p>1998年的高校扩招，标志着中国高等教育从“精英化”向“大众化”转型。这一政策的初衷在于为经济转型培养高素质劳动力。然而，随着高等教育规模的急速扩张，资源不足、质量下滑和就业压力成为不可回避的结果。扩招带来的直接后果是教育资源的摊薄。一些普通高校因扩招缺乏足够的师资力量和基础设施，教学质量难以保障。课程设计更加趋于标准化，削弱了对学生的个性化培养。2010年，全国大学毕业生人数达到620万，比1998年增长了四倍。然而，经济结构的调整未能与这一增长同步，岗位数量有限，导致“毕业即失业”现象突出。特别是农村学生，他们因缺乏社会资本和就业资源的支持，在竞争中处于不利地位。</p>

<p>The expansion of higher education in 1998 marked China's shift from "elite" education to "mass" education. The original intention of this policy was to cultivate high-quality labor for economic transformation. However, with the rapid expansion of higher education, resource shortages, quality decline, and employment pressure became inevitable results. The direct consequence of expansion was the dilution of educational resources. Some ordinary universities lacked sufficient teaching staff and infrastructure, making it difficult to guarantee teaching quality. Course designs became more standardized, weakening the personalized development of students. In 2010, the number of university graduates nationwide reached 6.2 million, a fourfold increase from 1998. However, the adjustment of the economic structure did not keep pace with this growth, and the number of jobs was limited, leading to a prominent "graduation equals unemployment" phenomenon. Particularly for rural students, their lack of social capital and employment resources puts them at a disadvantage in competition.</p>

<p>高校扩招虽表面上为农村学生提供了更多机会，但他们在起点上的劣势和终点上的资源缺乏，让这一机会看似平等却难以实现公平。农村学生通常来自教育资源匮乏的环境，他们在高考竞争中难以与城市学生抗衡。即使进入大学，也因基础知识薄弱和文化适应障碍而难以充分发挥潜力。布迪厄的社会资本理论指出，教育成功不仅依赖于学术能力，还需要文化和社会资源的支持。对于农村学生而言，家庭和社会网络的缺失让他们在职业选择和社会流动中始终处于弱势地位。</p>

<p>Although the expansion of higher education superficially provided more opportunities for rural students, their disadvantages at the starting point and the lack of resources at the endpoint made this opportunity seem equal but difficult to achieve fairness. Rural students usually come from environments with limited educational resources and struggle to compete with urban students in the college entrance examination. Even if they enter university, they often cannot fully realize their potential due to weak foundational knowledge and cultural adaptation difficulties. Bourdieu's theory of social capital points out that educational success depends not only on academic ability but also on cultural and social resources. For rural students, the lack of family and social networks makes them always disadvantaged in career choices and social mobility.</p>

<p>城乡教育资源的不均衡分配，是中国城乡剪刀差的一个核心表现。这种不平等不仅体现在硬件条件上，还反映在教育理念、文化认同和学生成长环境的差异中。我所就读的乡村小学教学条件极其简陋，教师需要兼任多门学科，教学方法单一。实验设备、图书馆和课外活动等在乡村学校几乎不存在，学生的学习以“填鸭式”教育为主。这种教育环境限制了学生的想象力和批判性思维的发展。尽管义务教育政策覆盖了绝大部分农村地区，但财政支持和执行力度不足。农村学校的经费严重依赖地方政府，而欠发达地区财政能力有限，导致学校发展滞后。</p>

<p>The uneven distribution of educational resources between urban and rural areas is a core manifestation of the urban-rural disparity in China. This inequality is not only reflected in hardware conditions but also in differences in educational philosophy, cultural identity, and students' growth environments. The rural primary school I attended had extremely poor teaching conditions, with teachers required to teach multiple subjects and a limited variety of teaching methods. There were almost no laboratory equipment, libraries, or extracurricular activities in rural schools, and students' learning was mostly based on rote memorization. This educational environment limited the development of students' imagination and critical thinking. Although the compulsory education policy covers most rural areas, financial support and enforcement are insufficient. Rural schools' funding heavily depends on local governments, and underdeveloped regions' limited fiscal capacity has led to slow school development.</p>

<p>城市学校则因政策倾斜和社会资本的集聚，形成了资源优势的垄断。城市重点学校拥有先进的教学设备、优秀的师资力量以及丰富的课外活动和国际化视野。这些条件不仅拓宽了学生的知识面，也为他们提供了更广阔的成长机会。当我转入城市重点学校后，第一次接触到现代化的教学环境。然而，我的乡村背景成为隐形的身份壁垒：口音、生活习惯、社交方式都让我显得格格不入。即使成绩优秀，我依然难以融入城市学生的圈层，这种排斥感进一步强化了城乡教育的不平等。</p>

<p>Urban schools, due to policy preferences and the concentration of social capital, have monopolized the advantage of resources. Key urban schools have advanced teaching equipment, excellent faculty, and a rich variety of extracurricular activities and international perspectives. These conditions not only broaden students' knowledge but also provide them with broader growth opportunities. When I transferred to a key urban school, I was exposed to a modern teaching environment for the first time. However, my rural background became an invisible identity barrier: my accent, habits, and social interactions made me feel out of place. Even with excellent grades, I still found it difficult to integrate into the social circles of urban students, and this sense of exclusion further reinforced the inequality in urban-rural education.</p>

<p>高校扩招的初衷是通过扩大教育覆盖面，为农村学生提供更多社会流动的机会。然而，这一政策忽视了城乡学生在资源和文化资本上的不对等，使得表面上的公平反而加剧了隐形的不平等。农村学生从义务教育开始就面临资源短缺的问题，在高考这一竞争平台上很难与城市学生抗衡。即使进入大学，他们在语言、知识广度和社会经验上也难以适应城市化的教育模式。农村学生通过高等教育获得的学历，其在社会流动中的作用逐渐减弱。就业市场的内卷化，让学历竞争更加白热化，而农村学生缺乏城市同龄人拥有的职业指导和社会关系，在就业竞争中处于明显劣势。</p>

<p>The original intention of the expansion of higher education was to broaden the coverage of education and provide more opportunities for social mobility for rural students. However, this policy ignored the imbalance in resources and cultural capital between urban and rural students, which made the apparent fairness exacerbate hidden inequality. Rural students have faced resource shortages since compulsory education and find it difficult to compete with urban students on the platform of the college entrance examination. Even if they enter university, they still struggle to adapt to the urbanized educational model due to language barriers, limited knowledge breadth, and lack of social experience. The degree obtained through higher education gradually loses its role in social mobility. The intense competition in the job market makes the competition for educational qualifications more fierce, while rural students lack career guidance and social connections that urban peers have, putting them at a clear disadvantage in the job market.</p>

<p>高校扩招虽然使入学率提升，但对农村学生的支持力度不足。奖学金和助学贷款等扶持政策覆盖面有限，农村学生的经济压力未能得到有效缓解。城市学校资源集中的现状，使得优质教育资源难以向农村地区扩散。即使有少量农村学生进入重点高校，他们也因文化适应障碍而难以充分发挥潜力。高校扩招曾为无数农村学生打开希望的大门，但资源分配的失衡和社会资本的缺失让这一希望在现实中显得虚幻而沉重。修复城乡教育的裂痕，不仅需要政策上的精准设计，更需要社会结构的全面变革。只有当每一个孩子都能在平等的土壤中成长，教育才真正成为改变命运的钥匙，而非延续不平等的工具。</p>

<p>Although the expansion of higher education has increased enrollment, the support for rural students has been insufficient. Support policies such as scholarships and student loans have limited coverage, and rural students' economic pressures have not been effectively alleviated. The concentration of resources in urban schools makes it difficult for quality educational resources to spread to rural areas. Even if a small number of rural students enter key universities, they still find it difficult to fully realize their potential due to cultural adaptation challenges. The expansion of higher education once opened doors of hope for countless rural students, but the imbalance in resource distribution and the lack of social capital made this hope seem elusive and burdensome in reality. To repair the urban-rural educational divide, not only precise policy design is needed, but also a comprehensive transformation of the social structure. Only when every child can grow up in equal soil can education truly become the key to changing their destiny, rather than a tool for perpetuating inequality.</p>


  <h1>Factory Experience: Alienation of Labor and Social Marginalization</h1>

<p>在16岁时，我选择休学进入沿海工厂。这段经历让我第一次面对工业化对个体的压迫，也让我深刻认识到城乡劳动力迁移与社会结构的不平等。流水线的机械性工作和城市社会的排斥让我体会到，经济增长的奇迹背后隐藏的是个体的工具化与边缘化。</p>

<p>At the age of 16, I chose to leave school and work in a coastal factory. This experience exposed me to the oppressive side of industrialization and made me deeply aware of the inequality in rural-urban labor migration and social structures. The mechanized work on the assembly line and the social exclusion in the city made me realize that behind the economic growth miracle lies the toolification and marginalization of individuals.</p>

<p>在流水线工作中，每一个动作都被量化，每一分每一秒都严格按照生产目标规划。劳动不再是表达创造力或体现自我价值的方式，而仅仅是满足生产需求的手段。马克思的劳动异化理论指出，当劳动者无法控制劳动成果时，他们会感到与劳动本身、劳动过程甚至劳动环境的疏离。这正是我在工厂流水线上的切身感受：机械化的劳动消除了人与工作的关联性，工作成了一种无意义的重复行为。在工厂中，劳动者被视为可以随时替代的“工具”。工厂管理者更关注效率和产能，而非个体的身心状态。这种对人的工具化利用，让我深刻感受到作为劳动者的无力感与孤立感。</p>

<p>On the assembly line, every action is quantified, and every minute and second is strictly planned according to production goals. Labor is no longer a means of expressing creativity or reflecting one's self-worth; it merely serves to meet production demands. Marx's theory of alienation of labor suggests that when workers cannot control the results of their labor, they feel alienated from the work itself, the process, and even the work environment. This was my personal experience on the factory assembly line: mechanized labor removed the connection between people and work, making the work feel like a meaningless repetitive task. In the factory, workers are seen as interchangeable "tools." Factory managers focus more on efficiency and production capacity rather than the physical and mental well-being of individuals. This toolification of people made me deeply feel the powerlessness and isolation of being a laborer.</p>

<p>在工厂之外，农民工群体面临的社会排斥感更加明显。作为一名年轻的农村女孩，我发现无论是工厂内部还是城市生活中，农民工始终被贴上“外来者”的标签。中国的户籍制度将农民工与城市福利体系隔离开来。尽管农民工为城市经济的运转提供了不可或缺的劳动力，但他们无法享受与城市居民等同的教育、医疗和住房福利。这种制度性排斥让农民工群体始终停留在“边缘阶层”。布迪厄的社会资本理论认为，社会资本的缺乏会限制个体的社会流动。农民工群体在城市中缺乏稳定的社会关系和文化认同，这种“文化孤岛”状态进一步加剧了城乡身份的断裂。</p>

<p>Beyond the factory, the social exclusion faced by migrant workers is even more evident. As a young rural girl, I found that whether inside the factory or in city life, migrant workers are always labeled as "outsiders." China's household registration system separates migrant workers from the urban welfare system. Although migrant workers provide essential labor for the operation of the urban economy, they cannot enjoy the same educational, healthcare, and housing benefits as urban residents. This institutional exclusion keeps migrant workers in a "marginal class." Bourdieu's theory of social capital suggests that the lack of social capital limits individual social mobility. Migrant workers in cities lack stable social relationships and cultural identity, and this "cultural isolation" further deepens the rupture of urban-rural identities.</p>

<p>户籍制度是农民工边缘化的核心制度性障碍。这一制度将城市和农村分割为两个完全不同的社会体系，使农民工成为“经济贡献者”而非“社会成员”。农民工子女在城市难以进入公立学校，只能选择教育质量较差的农民工子弟学校。这种教育壁垒让代际贫困循环得以延续。农民工群体长期缺乏医疗保险和社会保障，养老和疾病风险完全由个体和家庭承担。数据显示，截至2010年，超过70%的农民工没有签订正式劳动合同，劳动权益得不到保护。</p>

<p>The household registration system is the core institutional barrier to the marginalization of migrant workers. This system divides urban and rural areas into two completely different social systems, making migrant workers "economic contributors" rather than "social members." The children of migrant workers find it difficult to enter public schools in the city and can only attend migrant workers' schools with lower educational quality. This educational barrier perpetuates the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Migrant workers have long lacked health insurance and social security, and the risks of aging and illness are entirely borne by individuals and families. Statistics show that by 2010, more than 70% of migrant workers had not signed formal labor contracts, and their labor rights were not protected.</p>

<p>尽管中国出台了一系列劳动保护法律，但对农民工的覆盖和执行力度不足。工厂中的农民工通常没有固定劳动合同，工资结算和工作条件缺乏法律保障。加班文化、工资拖欠和工伤风险是农民工的普遍问题。农民工家庭收入的很大一部分通过高额房租、食品价格和城市生活成本重新回流到资本市场。尽管看似提高了生活水平，但家庭财富积累的可能性被大大削弱。</p>

<p>Although China has introduced a series of labor protection laws, the coverage and enforcement for migrant workers are insufficient. Migrant workers in factories typically do not have fixed labor contracts, and wage settlement and working conditions lack legal protection. Overtime culture, wage arrears, and the risk of workplace injuries are common issues for migrant workers. A large portion of migrant workers' family income is reinvested into the capital market through high rents, food prices, and the cost of urban living. Although this seemingly improves their living standards, the possibility of wealth accumulation for these families is significantly weakened.</p>

<p>个体的视角：从流水线到社会边缘</p>

<p>The individual perspective: From the assembly line to social marginalization</p>

<p>流水线上的生活让我意识到，工业化虽然提升了经济效率，却以牺牲个体价值为代价。每天重复机械的动作，让我感到自己成为一台机器的组成部分，失去了对工作的主导权和劳动成果的归属感。作为一名农村女孩，我既不属于工厂内部的核心管理群体，也无法融入城市社会的主流文化。这种身份上的边缘化，让我深刻认识到农村与城市之间不仅有经济上的差距，还有文化与社会资本的深层鸿沟。</p>

<p>Life on the assembly line made me realize that while industrialization increases economic efficiency, it comes at the cost of individual value. Repeating mechanical actions every day made me feel like a part of a machine, losing my control over work and the sense of ownership of my labor results. As a rural girl, I neither belonged to the core management group within the factory nor could I integrate into the mainstream culture of urban society. This marginalization of identity made me deeply realize that the gap between rural and urban areas is not only economic but also includes profound cultural and social capital divides.</p>

<p>我的工厂经历是中国工业化进程中数百万农民工生活的缩影。流水线的异化劳动不仅剥夺了个体对劳动的控制，也凸显了城乡劳动力迁移过程中制度设计的不足。要真正实现包容性发展，中国需要在政策和社会层面打破劳动者的边缘化境遇，让每一位参与经济建设的个体都能享有尊严与公平的权益。</p>

<p>My factory experience is a microcosm of the lives of millions of migrant workers in China's industrialization process. The alienation of labor on the assembly line not only deprived individuals of control over their work but also highlighted the inadequacies in the design of systems for rural-urban labor migration. To truly achieve inclusive development, China needs to break the marginalized status of laborers at both the policy and social levels, ensuring that every individual participating in economic development can enjoy dignity and fair rights.</p>
