<h1>K-12: Navigating Rural, Urban, and Provincial Education | K-12求学时代 (1998-2011)：从农村、小城市到省会城市的求学之旅，休学去沿海工厂打工的插曲 </h1>

<p>我的求学之路，既是一场地理上的迁徙，也是一段灵魂深处的流浪。从乡村的阡陌农田到省会城市的街头霓虹，这些年我跨越的不仅是空间，更是时代的断裂与自我的重塑。在中国城市化浪潮和教育改革的洪流中，我的成长犹如一颗沙砾，被裹挟、磨砺，最终雕刻出锋利的棱角。</p>
<p>My educational journey has been both a geographic migration and a spiritual wandering. From the rural fields of farmland to the neon-lit streets of provincial cities, the years I've crossed are not just spatial, but also the breaking of eras and the reshaping of myself. In the torrents of China’s urbanization and educational reform, my growth has been like a pebble, carried and polished, ultimately sculpted into sharp corners.</p>

<h2>初中：乡村到小城市的裂痕</h2>
<p>外公外婆的家是我童年的避风港，一个简单却充满温暖的地方。在那里，我的需求得到了满足，感受到无条件的爱。然而，随着他们相继去世，我的生活被迫进入一个全新的阶段：回到父母身边。这不仅是空间上的变化，更是一场情感上的震荡，是我成长道路上的第一道裂痕。在父母家，我很快意识到，这个环境与外公外婆家截然不同。母亲的脾气暴躁且控制欲极强，父亲则沉默寡言，几乎不干涉任何事情。家中的气氛压抑而冷漠，缺乏安全感和情感支持。这样的环境让我迅速明白，我无法依赖他人，必须为自己争取一切。</p>
<p>My grandfather and grandmother's home was a sanctuary during my childhood, a simple but warm place. There, my needs were met, and I felt unconditional love. However, with their passing, my life was forced into a new phase: returning to live with my parents. This was not just a change in space but an emotional shock, marking the first crack in my journey of growth. In my parents' home, I quickly realized that this environment was completely different from my grandparents’ home. My mother had a volatile temper and a strong need to control, while my father was silent, rarely intervening in anything. The atmosphere at home was oppressive and cold, lacking in security and emotional support. This environment quickly made me realize that I could not rely on others and had to fight for everything myself.</p>

<p>起初，我对母亲的批评逆来顺受，甚至努力通过优秀的表现来寻求她的认可。我以优异的成绩赢得老师的表扬，主动承担农活和家务活，想要证明自己是“好女儿”。然而，无论我多么努力，母亲的批评却从未停止。这让我开始怀疑：是否是我不够好？但初中生物课的一堂课改变了我。当老师讲到基因的概念时，我突然领悟到，或许父母对我的期待并不是出于爱，而是因为我承载了他们的基因。这份认知令我震惊，也让我第一次质疑“爱”的本质。这种怀疑埋下了叛逆的种子。我开始不再完全服从母亲的控制，而是尝试以自己的方式表达抗议。</p>
<p>At first, I passively accepted my mother’s criticism, even striving to gain her approval through excellent performance. I earned praise from my teachers for my good grades, and I took the initiative in farm work and housework, trying to prove myself as a “good daughter.” However, no matter how hard I tried, my mother’s criticism never stopped. This made me start to doubt: Am I not good enough? But one biology class in middle school changed me. When the teacher explained the concept of genes, I suddenly realized that perhaps my parents' expectations were not out of love, but because I carried their genes. This realization shocked me and made me question the very nature of “love” for the first time. This doubt planted the seed of rebellion. I began to no longer fully obey my mother’s control and instead tried to express my protest in my own way.</p>

<h2>高中：小城市的停滞与省会的重生</h2>
<p>在高中的第一学期期中考试中，我轻松考了全校第一。然而，从外公外婆家到父母身边，再到高中校园的这段迁徙并没有让我感到成就感，反而带来了深深的压抑。成绩的优秀并没有驱散我心中的疑问：“读书的意义究竟是什么？” 当时，这个问题像一道无法解开的谜题，让我开始厌倦枯燥的课业和日复一日的重复生活。我向父母提出休学的想法时，他们起初并不当真，以为这只是青少年的叛逆。然而，当我彻底停止上学，他们才意识到事态的严重性。亲戚们纷纷登门劝说，但没人能给我一个让我信服的答案。</p>
<p>In my first semester of high school, I easily ranked first in the whole school. However, the migration from my grandparents' home to my parents' and then to high school did not give me a sense of accomplishment. Instead, it brought deep oppression. My excellent grades did not dispel the question in my mind: “What is the point of studying?” At that time, this question was like an unsolvable riddle, making me start to grow weary of the monotonous schoolwork and repetitive life. When I proposed to my parents that I wanted to take a break from school, they initially dismissed it, thinking it was just teenage rebellion. However, when I completely stopped going to school, they realized the seriousness of the situation. Relatives came to persuade me, but no one could provide an answer that convinced me.</p>

<p>学习不是我的抗争，而是对“生活”的抗议。最终，我做了一个当时看来是大胆而绝望的决定：假借一张身份证，去江苏投奔正在沿海工厂打工的姐姐。对于一个来自农村的女孩来说，社会提供的选项少得可怜。我起初在网吧做收银员，后来到服装店卖衣服，最后进入了工厂。这段经历的时间虽然短暂，却让我体会到了从未感受过的深渊。</p>
<p>Study was not my struggle; it was a protest against “life.” Eventually, I made a bold and desperate decision: using a fake ID to join my sister working in a factory along the coast in Jiangsu. For a girl from the countryside, the options society provided were terribly scarce. Initially, I worked as a cashier in an internet cafe, then sold clothes in a clothing store, and finally, I entered a factory. Though the experience was short, it exposed me to an abyss I had never felt before.</p>

<h2>大学：迷茫与叛逆之间，走向世界的道路</h2>
<p>高考并非如预期所理想，我进入中国的一所二本院校。我陷入了一种深刻的怀疑之中：努力的意义是什么？ 我像无数个同龄人一样，在应试教育的体系中被定义、被规范，被告知什么是“正确的人生轨迹”。可我始终觉得，脚下那条所谓“被规划好”的路，像一张网，把我束缚在了某种沉闷的规则中，喘不过气。</p>
<p>The college entrance examination didn’t go as expected, and I entered a second-tier university in China. I fell into deep doubt: What is the meaning of effort? Like countless peers, I was defined, standardized, and told what the “correct life trajectory” was within the exam-oriented education system. But I always felt that the so-called “planned path” beneath my feet was like a net, suffocating me within a dull set of rules.</p>

<p>大学即将毕业时，C邀请我参加世界儿童艺术节，并愿意资助我全部的费用。这是一份不可思议的礼物，也是我人生第一次感受到跨越边界的可能性。 带着忐忑与希望，我踏上了飞往华盛顿的航班。当飞机降落时，我透过舷窗望向那片陌生的土地，心中浮现的是一种复杂的情感：恐惧、兴奋，还有一种久违的自由。站在华盛顿特区的街头，我第一次感受到什么叫做“人类的共同命运”。这座城市的每一面墙、每一块广告牌都在谈论环境保护、教育改革和人权。</p>
<p>As I was about to graduate from university, C invited me to participate in the World Children's Art Festival and offered to fund all my expenses. It was an incredible gift, and the first time in my life that I felt the possibility of crossing boundaries. Filled with nervousness and hope, I boarded the flight to Washington. As the plane landed, I looked out the window at the unfamiliar land, and complex emotions arose in me: fear, excitement, and a long-lost sense of freedom. Standing on the streets of Washington D.C., I experienced for the first time what it means to be part of "humanity's shared destiny." Every wall, every billboard in this city was talking about environmental protection, education reform, and human rights.</p>

<p>在那个瞬间，我忽然意识到：这不正是我一直寻找的世界吗？一个追求公正与美好的地方，一个相信每个人都有力量去改变命运的舞台。</p>
<p>In that moment, I suddenly realized: Isn’t this the world I’ve been searching for? A place that pursues justice and beauty, a stage that believes everyone has the power to change their destiny.</p>

<h2>32岁的我：对三个求学阶段的自己说的话</h2>
<p>对初中的自己：承认你的痛苦，保护你的纯真</p>
<p>To my middle school self: Acknowledge your pain, protect your innocence.</p>

<p>亲爱的14岁的自己，</p>
<p>Dear 14-year-old me,</p>

<p>我知道你正在经历人生中的第一次裂痕。失去了外公外婆，你不得不面对一个冰冷、苛责的家庭环境。在这个小小的乡村中，你感觉不到温暖，只有母亲的尖刻和父亲的沉默让你痛苦。你常常怀疑自己是否足够好，甚至开始怀疑爱是否真的存在。但我想告诉你：那些否定你的话语从未定义你的价值，你天生就值得被爱。</p>
<p>I know you’re going through your first crack in life. Having lost your grandfather and grandmother, you have to face a cold, harsh family environment. In this small village, you don’t feel warmth, only your mother’s sharp words and your father’s silence causing you pain. You often doubt whether you are good enough, and even begin to question whether love really exists. But I want to tell you: those words that deny you have never defined your value, you were born worthy of love.</p>

<p>你以为每一次母亲的责备都是你的错，其实不然。她的痛苦、她的控制欲，并不是你的责任。这种对爱的怀疑虽然深深刺痛了你，但它同时让你学会了独立思考。你开始反抗，开始用知识保护自己，甚至用课堂上的基因理论去挑战那些理所当然的束缚。这种勇气是你灵魂中最珍贵的部分，请一定守护它。</p>
<p>You thought every criticism from your mother was your fault, but it was not. Her pain, her need for control, is not your responsibility. Although this doubt about love deeply hurt you, it also taught you to think independently. You began to rebel, using knowledge to protect yourself, even using the concept of genes from biology class to challenge the seemingly inevitable constraints. This courage is the most precious part of your soul, please protect it at all costs.</p>

<p>外公外婆对你无条件的爱会永远成为你心中的一盏灯，它会引导你在未来最黑暗的时刻找到希望。即便在你孤立无援的时候，记住：你的世界远比眼前的乡村和家庭更广阔。互联网刚刚打开了一扇窗，那些网吧里闪烁的屏幕会让你窥见世界的无穷可能。你不知道未来会是什么样子，但只要你勇敢向外走，总有一天，你会看到自己想要的世界。</p>
<p>Your grandparents' unconditional love will always be a light in your heart, guiding you to find hope in the darkest moments ahead. Even when you feel isolated and helpless, remember: your world is far broader than the village and family you see now. The internet has just opened a window, and the flashing screens in internet cafes will give you a glimpse of the infinite possibilities in the world. You may not know what the future will look like, but as long as you bravely step out, one day, you will see the world you desire.</p>

<p>对高中的自己：在迷茫中前行，不要害怕失败</p>
<p>To my high school self: Move forward through confusion, don’t fear failure.</p>

<p>亲爱的16岁的自己，</p>
<p>Dear 16-year-old me,</p>

<p>我看到你从乡村来到小城市，从成绩优异到休学，从课堂走向工厂。你经历了被羞辱、被忽视，甚至在工厂中体会到了前所未有的绝望。你开始怀疑努力的意义：为什么努力，只是换来更多的痛苦？你用倔强对抗所有的规则，用叛逆保护自己的尊严。但我要告诉你：即便现在看不到出口，每一次的迷茫，都是未来成长的土壤。</p>
<p>I see you coming from the countryside to a small city, from excellent grades to dropping out, from the classroom to the factory. You’ve experienced humiliation, being ignored, and even felt unprecedented despair in the factory. You begin to doubt the meaning of effort: why does effort only bring more pain? You use stubbornness to fight against all the rules, using rebellion to protect your dignity. But I want to tell you: even if you can’t see the way out now, every moment of confusion is the soil for your future growth.</p>

<p>当你在工厂的流水线上感受到人生的尽头时，你第一次接触到了社会的真实面貌。你看到了冷漠、疏离，也看到了底层生活的艰辛。这段经历不会成为你的终点，它会成为你的力量。你学会了在困境中生存，学会了在压迫中找到自己的方向。正是这些苦难，让你比同龄人更早地明白，真正的自由和归属感需要靠自己争取。</p>
<p>When you feel like you’ve reached the end of life on the assembly line in the factory, you’re encountering the harsh reality of society for the first time. You see indifference, alienation, and the hardships of life at the bottom. This experience will not become your end, it will become your strength. You learned to survive in adversity, to find your way in oppression. It’s these hardships that made you understand earlier than your peers that true freedom and belonging must be fought for by yourself.</p>

<p>当你决定返回学校，用奖学金为自己争取一个新的起点时，你已经在迈向未来的路上。那些外人眼中的倔强和叛逆，其实是你最宝贵的品质——它们会让你不断追求更好的生活。在那个小小的私立学校里，你开始感受到温暖的支持，也第一次发现自己可以通过努力改变命运。不要因为失败而自责，也不要因为暂时的成就而骄傲。你的未来刚刚开始，而你拥有无限可能。</p>
<p>When you decide to return to school and use your scholarship to secure a new start, you are already on the path to the future. The stubbornness and rebellion that others see in you are actually your most valuable qualities — they will lead you to continually pursue a better life. In that small private school, you begin to feel the warmth of support, and for the first time, you realize you can change your destiny through hard work. Don’t blame yourself for failures, and don’t become arrogant because of temporary achievements. Your future has just begun, and you have unlimited possibilities.</p>

<p>对大学的自己：不要怀疑你的选择，你正在走向广阔的世界</p>
<p>To my university self: Don’t doubt your choices, you are heading towards a broader world.</p>

<p>亲爱的20岁的自己，</p>
<p>Dear 20-year-old me,</p>

<p>我知道你刚刚进入大学时感到巨大的迷茫：校园生活的平庸、应试教育的死板让你感到窒息。你一次次问自己：努力的意义是什么？为什么大多数人都满足于循规蹈矩？在那些孤独的日子里，你泡在图书馆，用书籍填补空虚，用知识寻找出口。我要告诉你，这种对知识的渴望是你生命中最独特的力量，它会引导你走向更大的世界。</p>
<p>I know you felt a great sense of confusion when you entered university: the mediocrity of campus life, the rigidity of exam-oriented education suffocated you. You kept asking yourself: What is the meaning of effort? Why do most people settle for following the rules? During those lonely days, you immersed yourself in the library, filling the emptiness with books and searching for an exit with knowledge. I want to tell you, this thirst for knowledge is your most unique power, it will guide you to a bigger world.</p>

<p>当你开始远离传统课堂，接触TED演讲和开放课程时，你已经在摆脱教育体制的束缚。你在虚拟的课堂里探索哲学、社会科学、金融学，从哈佛到耶鲁，从中国到世界，你的思维已经突破了空间的限制。那些孤独的自学时光，正是你未来成长的基石。</p>
<p>When you began to move away from traditional classrooms and engage with TED talks and online courses, you were already breaking free from the constraints of the educational system. You explored philosophy, social science, finance, from Harvard to Yale, from China to the world. Your thinking has already broken the limits of space. Those solitary self-study moments are the foundation for your future growth.</p>

<p>你以为自己只是一个普通的女孩，却无意间抓住了一个改变命运的机会。那个英国人C的邀请看似偶然，实则是你内心开放与探索的结果。当你踏上华盛顿的街头，第一次感受到人权、教育和环境保护的力量时，你终于明白：世界的广阔，远远超越了你曾经的想象。</p>
<p>You thought you were just an ordinary girl, but you unintentionally grasped an opportunity to change your fate. That British man C’s invitation seemed like a coincidence, but it was actually the result of your inner openness and exploration. When you stepped onto the streets of Washington D.C., and for the first time felt the power of human rights, education, and environmental protection, you finally realized: the vastness of the world far exceeds what you had imagined.</p>

<p>不要害怕你的叛逆，也不要害怕那些“不合群”的时刻。你的路从来不是为任何人而走，它只属于你自己。正是那些偏离轨道的选择，让你走向了今天的自由。未来的你会站在纽约的街头，怀念那些孤独的时光，因为正是这些时光，让你成为了一个内心丰盈的人。</p>
<p>Don’t fear your rebellion, and don’t be afraid of those “outsider” moments. Your path was never meant for anyone else, it only belongs to you. It’s those off-track choices that led you to the freedom you enjoy today. The future you will stand on the streets of New York, remembering those lonely times, because it was those moments that made you a person with a rich inner life.</p>

<h2>32岁的我对自己的和解</h2>
<p>14岁的我，你的孤独让我明白了爱的珍贵。16岁的我，你的倔强让我学会了在困境中争取自由。20岁的我，你的叛逆让我踏上了一条通向世界的道路。我们每一个阶段的痛苦与挣扎，都是生命中不可或缺的章节。它们没有让我成为他人眼中的 “成功者”，却让我成为一个真实的自己。</p>
<p>32-year-old me: The loneliness you felt at 14 taught me the value of love. At 16, your stubbornness taught me to fight for freedom in adversity. At 20, your rebellion set me on a path toward the world. Every pain and struggle in each of these stages is an indispensable chapter of life. They didn’t make me a “successful person” in others’ eyes, but they made me a real person.</p>

<p>站在32岁的纽约街头，我想对你们说：谢谢你们没有放弃自己。是你们的孤独让我学会珍惜；是你们的叛逆让我学会思考；是你们的渴望让我找到世界的意义。</p>
<p>Standing on the streets of New York at 32, I want to say to you: Thank you for not giving up on yourselves. Your loneliness taught me to cherish; your rebellion taught me to think; your desires helped me find the meaning of the world.</p>




  <h1>成长在断裂中的农村孩子：经济改革、城乡差距与文化冲突的深层剖析</h1>
<h1>Growing Up as a Rural Child in the Broken Divide: A Deep Analysis of Economic Reforms, Urban-Rural Gaps, and Cultural Conflicts</h1>

<hr>

<h2>1. 经济改革的双刃剑：从奇迹到隐形剥夺</h2>
<h2>1. The Double-Edged Sword of Economic Reforms: From Miracle to Invisible Deprivation</h2>

<p>1998年至2011年，中国的经济改革进入深化阶段，成为全球化时代经济发展的典范。加入WTO后，中国以出口驱动、基础设施建设和开放市场为核心策略，将沿海地区迅速打造为全球供应链的枢纽。工业化的飞速发展推动了中国GDP年均增长率突破10%，跻身全球第二大经济体。这一阶段的经济增长，被广泛誉为“全球化的中国样本”。</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2011, China’s economic reforms entered a deepening phase, becoming a model of economic development in the era of globalization. After joining the WTO, China’s strategy focused on export-driven growth, infrastructure development, and opening markets, rapidly transforming coastal regions into the global supply chain hub. The rapid industrialization led to China’s GDP growth rate exceeding 10% annually, making it the second-largest economy in the world. This phase of economic growth is widely regarded as the “globalized Chinese model.”</p>

<p>然而，这场经济奇迹隐藏着深刻的不平等。城乡资源的分配失衡，不仅体现在收入差距，更在于政策导向和资本流动的偏向。农村成为了“供血者”，被动地支持城市的现代化和全球化进程。按照大卫·哈维的资本流动理论，资本天然趋向于高回报的区域。在中国，沿海城市得到了政策倾斜、资本注入和基础设施建设的优先支持，成为外资的首选之地。而农村，尤其是内陆地区，则因回报率低、产业发展滞后，逐渐边缘化。1998年，农村人均可支配收入仅为城市的50%；到2011年，这一比例进一步下降至35%。这种收入剪刀差不仅意味着财富的不平等，还表明农村人群在教育、医疗和社会保障等方面长期被剥夺，形成了全方位的资源失衡。</p>
<p>However, this economic miracle conceals profound inequality. The imbalanced distribution of resources between urban and rural areas is reflected not only in income gaps but also in policy orientation and the flow of capital. The rural areas became “donors,” passively supporting the urbanization and globalization process. According to David Harvey's theory of capital flow, capital naturally gravitates toward high-return areas. In China, coastal cities received preferential policies, capital injections, and infrastructure development, becoming the preferred destinations for foreign investment. In contrast, rural areas, especially inland regions, have become marginalized due to low returns and underdeveloped industries. In 1998, the per capita disposable income in rural areas was only 50% of that in cities; by 2011, this ratio had further declined to 35%. This income disparity not only indicates wealth inequality but also reflects the long-term deprivation of rural populations in terms of education, healthcare, and social security, resulting in an overall imbalance in resources.</p>

<p>城乡发展的不对称，形成了一种“汲取式”资源转移模式。农村提供了土地、劳动力和基础资源，但这些资源的利用回报却被城市吸纳，农村没有形成产业积累或经济反哺机制。超过2亿农民工流入城市，为制造业、建筑业和服务业提供廉价劳动力。然而，由于户籍制度限制，这些劳动力被排除在城市公共服务体系之外。他们不仅无法享受与城市居民同等的社会保障，还要承担高昂的住房、教育等生活成本。农村劳动力外流，使农业劳动力逐步老龄化，农村经济陷入低水平生产的循环。与此同时，土地被用于城市扩张和工业园区建设，农民的土地权益受到压缩。任何经济模式的收益增长，必然伴随成本的再分配。中国的城市化和工业化，把隐形成本转嫁到了农村家庭和儿童身上。农民工外出务工导致大量留守儿童的出现。据统计，2010年中国有超过6000万留守儿童，他们不仅缺乏父母的情感陪伴，还承担了远超年龄负担的家庭责任。留守儿童因教育资源匮乏和社会资本缺失，在职业选择和社会流动中处于显著劣势。他们的成长代价成为城市经济发展的“隐形成本”，也为未来的代际贫困埋下了伏笔。</p>
<p>The asymmetry of urban and rural development has formed a “drainage-type” resource transfer model. Rural areas provide land, labor, and basic resources, but the returns from utilizing these resources are absorbed by urban areas, and the rural areas fail to accumulate industries or create an economic feedback mechanism. Over 200 million migrant workers have moved to cities, providing cheap labor for manufacturing, construction, and service industries. However, due to the household registration system (hukou) restrictions, these laborers are excluded from the urban public service system. They not only cannot enjoy the same social security as urban residents but also bear high housing, education, and living costs. The outflow of rural labor leads to the gradual aging of agricultural laborers, and the rural economy falls into a cycle of low-level production. Meanwhile, land is used for urban expansion and industrial park construction, with farmers’ land rights being compressed. Any economic model’s profit growth is inevitably accompanied by the redistribution of costs. China’s urbanization and industrialization have shifted the invisible costs to rural families and children. The migration of migrant workers has led to a large number of left-behind children. According to statistics, in 2010, there were more than 60 million left-behind children in China, who not only lacked emotional companionship from their parents but also bore family responsibilities far beyond their age. Due to the lack of educational resources and social capital, left-behind children are at a significant disadvantage in terms of career choices and social mobility. Their growth costs have become the “invisible cost” of urban economic development and have sown the seeds for intergenerational poverty in the future.</p>

<p>我的经历：经济剪刀差的切肤之痛</p>
<p>My Experience: The Acute Pain of the Economic Scissors Gap</p>

<p>我出生于湖南乡村，这片土地是中国经济增长体系中的边缘地带。尽管我的父母没有选择外出务工，而是将我寄养在外公外婆家，我的成长依然深刻地被城乡差距的裂痕所影响。我的故事，既是个体的经历，也是那个时代无数农村家庭共同命运的缩影。</p>
<p>I was born in rural Hunan, a marginalized area within China’s economic growth system. Although my parents did not choose to work outside, instead, they sent me to live with my grandparents, my growth was still deeply influenced by the divide between urban and rural areas. My story is not only a personal experience but also a reflection of the shared fate of countless rural families of that era.</p>

<p>我的父母没有像许多家庭那样外出务工，而是将我寄养在外公外婆的家中。这种安排尽管避免了亲子关系的完全断裂，但依然带来了情感上的疏离。外公外婆的陪伴弥补了父母情感的缺席，他们的关爱为我提供了成长中难得的温暖。然而，寄养生活同时也意味着情感的分裂——我在亲密关系中被动接受安排，却对父母产生了距离感。他们的选择让我意识到家庭经济压力的存在，但也让我感受到一种被疏忽的孤独。外公外婆以他们传统、质朴的方式照顾我，但他们的教育模式与现代学校教育的要求之间存在断层。我感受到一种情感上的依赖，却无法从中获取对未来社会竞争力的帮助。与之相对，我的父母承担起家庭经济的主要压力，但他们在情感支持和教育引导上的缺位，让这种成长充满矛盾。</p>
<p>My parents did not follow the common path of migrant workers, instead sending me to live with my grandparents. This arrangement, while avoiding a complete rupture in parent-child relationships, still brought emotional separation. My grandparents’ companionship filled the emotional gap left by my parents, providing the warmth that was rare in my upbringing. However, foster care also meant emotional fragmentation — I passively accepted the arrangements in close relationships, but developed a sense of distance from my parents. Their choice made me aware of the economic pressures in the family, but it also made me feel a neglected loneliness. My grandparents cared for me in their traditional, simple way, but there was a gap between their educational approach and the demands of modern school education. I felt emotional dependence but could not gain assistance for future social competitiveness. In contrast, my parents bore the major economic pressure of the family, but their absence in emotional support and educational guidance made this growth full of contradictions.</p>

<p>从小生活在寄养环境中，我被迫更早地承担责任。这种环境教会我独立，但也让我过早地感受到压力。由于父母的经济状况有限，我学会了节俭与责任。我知道每一笔开支都代表了家庭的负担，因此，我早早意识到，只有通过优异的学业表现才能证明自己的价值，改变未来的命运。在寄养环境中，我常常被迫面对乡村社会的议论。他们对寄养儿童的标签化认知，以及对家庭背景的好奇，使我更早地学会隐藏脆弱。这种经验让我形成了强烈的自我要求，但也让我对外界的评价格外敏感。</p>
<p>Living in a foster environment from a young age, I was forced to take on responsibilities earlier. This environment taught me independence, but also made me feel the pressure much earlier. Due to my parents’ limited economic situation, I learned to be frugal and responsible. I knew that every expense represented a burden on the family, so I quickly realized that only through excellent academic performance could I prove my worth and change my future fate. In the foster environment, I was often forced to face the gossip of rural society. Their stereotypical views of foster children and curiosity about family backgrounds made me learn to hide my vulnerability early. This experience created strong self-expectations, but also made me unusually sensitive to external judgments.</p>

<p>乡村的教育资源短缺让我从一开始就站在了不平等的起跑线上。尽管我的寄养生活为我提供了一定的情感支持，但教育资源的匮乏却是我无法回避的现实。我的村小仅有几名教师，同时教授多门学科。教学资源的贫乏和课程的单一，让我的学习体验极为有限。实验室、图书馆、课外活动，这些在城市学校看似平常的设施，对我们来说几乎是无法想象的奢侈。乡村学校的教学质量，直接影响了学生在升学中的竞争力。尽管我凭借自己的努力进入了城市的重点中学，但城乡资源的不平等，尤其是语言、生活习惯和文化背景的差异，让我感受到一种无形的“圈层排斥”。</p>
<p>The shortage of educational resources in rural areas placed me at an unequal starting line from the very beginning. While my foster life provided some emotional support, the lack of educational resources was an inescapable reality. My village school had only a few teachers, who taught multiple subjects. The lack of teaching resources and the narrow curriculum made my learning experience extremely limited. Facilities such as laboratories, libraries, and extracurricular activities, which seem ordinary in urban schools, were almost unimaginable luxuries to us. The quality of teaching in rural schools directly affected students’ competitiveness in further education. Although I entered a key urban school through my efforts, the unequal urban-rural resources, especially differences in language, living habits, and cultural backgrounds, made me feel an invisible “social exclusion.”</p>

<p>我的寄养生活虽然不同于典型的“留守儿童”经历，但我目睹了周围许多家庭的父母外出务工，他们的孩子因父母的离开而成为真正的“留守儿童”。农民工为城市贡献了廉价劳动力，但却因户籍制度被排除在城市的福利和公共服务之外。他们的收入常常难以支撑家庭的长远利益，孩子的教育和成长需求得不到满足。研究显示，留守儿童更易产生情感缺失、学业压力大和社会适应困难等问题。我目睹了许多留守儿童因缺乏父母的陪伴和指导而在成长中遭遇挫折，甚至陷入犯罪或心理问题的困境。城乡户籍制度和教育资源分配的不均衡，让乡村成为城市经济发展的“供血者”。父母外出务工的经济收益有限，而农村家庭和儿童却承担了情感缺失和机会不均的长期代价。</p>
<p>Although my foster life was different from the typical "left-behind children" experience, I witnessed many families around me where the parents migrated for work, leaving their children as true “left-behind children.” Migrant workers contribute cheap labor to cities but are excluded from the city’s welfare and public services due to the household registration system (hukou). Their income often cannot support the long-term interests of their families, and children’s educational and developmental needs are not met. Studies show that left-behind children are more likely to experience emotional deprivation, academic pressure, and social adaptation difficulties. I witnessed many left-behind children encountering setbacks during their growth due to the lack of parental companionship and guidance, even falling into crime or psychological problems. The urban-rural household registration system and the unequal distribution of educational resources have made rural areas the “donors” for urban economic development.

<p>当我进入城市重点中学后，口音、行为和生活习惯的差异让我难以融入。这种城乡文化的冲突让我明白，城乡差距不仅是资源的不平等，更是文化的边界。寄养经历让我从小意识到，个人努力难以完全对抗制度性的屏障。教育资源的不平等、城乡社会资本的差异，以及经济剪刀差的固化，让个体奋斗显得微不足道。这种认识驱使我更加努力，但也让我对社会的不公平深感无力。</p>
<p>When I entered a key urban school, the differences in accent, behavior, and living habits made it difficult for me to integrate. This urban-rural cultural conflict made me realize that the urban-rural gap is not only an inequality in resources but also a cultural boundary. My foster experience made me realize early on that personal effort cannot fully overcome institutional barriers. The inequality of educational resources, the differences in social capital between urban and rural areas, and the solidification of the economic scissors gap made individual struggles seem insignificant. This realization drove me to work harder but also left me feeling helpless against the unfairness in society.</p>

<p>从小生活在寄养环境中，我被迫更早地承担责任。这种环境教会我独立，但也让我过早地感受到压力。由于父母的经济状况有限，我学会了节俭与责任。我知道每一笔开支都代表了家庭的负担，因此，我早早意识到，只有通过优异的学业表现才能证明自己的价值，改变未来的命运。在寄养环境中，我常常被迫面对乡村社会的议论。他们对寄养儿童的标签化认知，以及对家庭背景的好奇，使我更早地学会隐藏脆弱。这种经验让我形成了强烈的自我要求，但也让我对外界的评价格外敏感。</p>
<p>Living in a foster environment from a young age, I was forced to take on responsibilities earlier. This environment taught me independence, but also made me feel the pressure much earlier. Due to my parents’ limited economic situation, I learned to be frugal and responsible. I knew that every expense represented a burden on the family, so I quickly realized that only through excellent academic performance could I prove my worth and change my future fate. In the foster environment, I was often forced to face the gossip of rural society. Their stereotypical views of foster children and curiosity about family backgrounds made me learn to hide my vulnerability early. This experience created strong self-expectations, but also made me unusually sensitive to external judgments.</p>

<p>乡村的教育资源短缺让我从一开始就站在了不平等的起跑线上。尽管我的寄养生活为我提供了一定的情感支持，但教育资源的匮乏却是我无法回避的现实。我的村小仅有几名教师，同时教授多门学科。教学资源的贫乏和课程的单一，让我的学习体验极为有限。实验室、图书馆、课外活动，这些在城市学校看似平常的设施，对我们来说几乎是无法想象的奢侈。乡村学校的教学质量，直接影响了学生在升学中的竞争力。尽管我凭借自己的努力进入了城市的重点中学，但城乡资源的不平等，尤其是语言、生活习惯和文化背景的差异，让我感受到一种无形的“圈层排斥”。</p>
<p>The shortage of educational resources in rural areas placed me at an unequal starting line from the very beginning. While my foster life provided some emotional support, the lack of educational resources was an inescapable reality. My village school had only a few teachers, who taught multiple subjects. The lack of teaching resources and the narrow curriculum made my learning experience extremely limited. Facilities such as laboratories, libraries, and extracurricular activities, which seem ordinary in urban schools, were almost unimaginable luxuries to us. The quality of teaching in rural schools directly affected students’ competitiveness in further education. Although I entered a key urban school through my efforts, the unequal urban-rural resources, especially differences in language, living habits, and cultural backgrounds, made me feel an invisible “social exclusion.”</p>

<p>我的寄养生活虽然不同于典型的“留守儿童”经历，但我目睹了周围许多家庭的父母外出务工，他们的孩子因父母的离开而成为真正的“留守儿童”。农民工为城市贡献了廉价劳动力，但却因户籍制度被排除在城市的福利和公共服务之外。他们的收入常常难以支撑家庭的长远利益，孩子的教育和成长需求得不到满足。研究显示，留守儿童更易产生情感缺失、学业压力大和社会适应困难等问题。我目睹了许多留守儿童因缺乏父母的陪伴和指导而在成长中遭遇挫折，甚至陷入犯罪或心理问题的困境。城乡户籍制度和教育资源分配的不均衡，让乡村成为城市经济发展的“供血者”。父母外出务工的经济收益有限，而农村家庭和儿童却承担了情感缺失和机会不均的长期代价。</p>
<p>Although my foster life was different from the typical "left-behind children" experience, I witnessed many families around me where the parents migrated for work, leaving their children as true “left-behind children.” Migrant workers contribute cheap labor to cities but are excluded from the city’s welfare and public services due to the household registration system (hukou). Their income often cannot support the long-term interests of their families, and children’s educational and developmental needs are not met. Studies show that left-behind children are more likely to experience emotional deprivation, academic pressure, and social adaptation difficulties. I witnessed many left-behind children encountering setbacks during their growth due to the lack of parental companionship and guidance, even falling into crime or psychological problems. The urban-rural household registration system and the unequal distribution of educational resources have made rural areas the “donors” for urban economic development. The economic benefits of parents working away from home are limited, while rural families and children bear the long-term costs of emotional deprivation and unequal opportunities.</p>

capital restricts an individual's social mobility. Migrant workers face severe cultural exclusion in cities. Their lifestyles, language habits, and social networks are difficult to integrate into mainstream urban society. This marginalization further exacerbates the identity crisis they face.</p>

<p>户籍制度是农民工边缘化的核心制度性障碍。这一制度将城市和农村分割为两个完全不同的社会体系，使农民工成为“经济贡献者”而非“社会成员”。农民工子女在城市难以进入公立学校，只能选择教育质量较差的农民工子弟学校。这种教育壁垒让代际贫困循环得以延续。农民工群体长期缺乏医疗保险和社会保障，养老和疾病风险完全由个体和家庭承担。数据显示，截至2010年，超过70%的农民工没有签订正式劳动合同，劳动权益得不到保护。</p>

<p>The household registration system (hukou) is the core institutional barrier to the marginalization of migrant workers. This system divides cities and rural areas into two entirely different social systems, making migrant workers "economic contributors" rather than "social members." The children of migrant workers find it difficult to enter public schools in the cities, and must instead attend migrant workers' schools with lower educational quality. This educational barrier perpetuates intergenerational poverty. Migrant workers have long been without medical insurance and social security, and the risks of old age and illness are entirely borne by the individual and their family. Statistics show that, by 2010, over 70% of migrant workers had not signed formal labor contracts, and their labor rights were not protected.</p>

<p>尽管中国出台了一系列劳动保护法律，但对农民工的覆盖和执行力度不足。工厂中的农民工通常没有固定劳动合同，工资结算和工作条件缺乏法律保障。加班文化、工资拖欠和工伤风险是农民工的普遍问题。农民工家庭收入的很大一部分通过高额房租、食品价格和城市生活成本重新回流到资本市场。尽管看似提高了生活水平，但家庭财富积累的可能性被大大削弱。</p>

<p>Despite China’s introduction of a series of labor protection laws, their coverage and enforcement for migrant workers have been insufficient. In factories, migrant workers often do not have fixed labor contracts, and their wages, settlement processes, and working conditions lack legal protection. Overtime culture, wage arrears, and workplace injury risks are common issues for migrant workers. A large portion of migrant workers' household income is redirected back into the capital market through high rents, food prices, and urban living costs. Although it seems that their living standards have improved, the possibility of family wealth accumulation has been significantly weakened.</p>

<p>个体的视角：从流水线到社会边缘</p>
<p>流水线上的生活让我意识到，工业化虽然提升了经济效率，却以牺牲个体价值为代价。每天重复机械的动作，让我感到自己成为一台机器的组成部分，失去了对工作的主导权和劳动成果的归属感。作为一名农村女孩，我既不属于工厂内部的核心管理群体，也无法融入城市社会的主流文化。这种身份上的边缘化，让我深刻认识到农村与城市之间不仅有经济上的差距，还有文化与社会资本的深层鸿沟。</p>

<p>From the perspective of the individual: from the assembly line to social marginalization</p>
<p>Life on the assembly line made me realize that although industrialization improved economic efficiency, it came at the cost of individual value. The repetitive mechanical movements every day made me feel like a part of a machine, losing control over the work and the sense of ownership of the labor's results. As a rural girl, I neither belonged to the core management group within the factory nor could I integrate into the mainstream urban culture. This marginalization of identity made me deeply realize that the gap between rural and urban life is not only economic but also includes deep cultural and social capital divides.</p>

<p>我的工厂经历是中国工业化进程中数百万农民工生活的缩影。流水线的异化劳动不仅剥夺了个体对劳动的控制，也凸显了城乡劳动力迁移过程中制度设计的不足。要真正实现包容性发展，中国需要在政策和社会层面打破劳动者的边缘化境遇，让每一位参与经济建设的个体都能享有尊严与公平的权益。</p>

<p>My factory experience is a microcosm of the lives of millions of migrant workers in China's industrialization process. The alienated labor on the assembly line not only deprived individuals of control over their labor but also highlighted the inadequacies in the institutional design of rural-urban labor migration. To truly achieve inclusive development, China needs to break the marginalization of workers at both the policy and social levels, ensuring that every individual involved in economic development has dignity and fair rights.</p>

<p>结语：个人成长与时代反思</p>
<p>我的成长是城乡差距与社会转型的缩影。在城乡断裂的现实中，我切身体验了制度屏障对个人发展的影响。然而，我也看到了变革的可能性：通过经济再平衡、户籍改革、教育赋能和文化融合，城乡断裂的鸿沟可以逐步弥合。</p>

<p>Conclusion: Personal Growth and Reflection on the Times</p>
<p>My growth is a microcosm of the gap between urban and rural areas and the societal transformation. In the reality of urban-rural divides, I personally experienced the impact of institutional barriers on individual development. However, I also see the possibility for change: through economic rebalancing, hukou reform, education empowerment, and cultural integration, the gap between urban and rural areas can gradually be bridged.</p>

<p>这种弥合不仅关系到个人命运，也决定了中国社会的可持续发展。城乡协调发展不是资源的单向流动，而是共生与互补的关系。未来，每个孩子，无论出生于城市还是乡村，都应该有机会享受平等的资源与选择权。社会的进步，归根到底在于个体的自由与尊严得以保障。</p>

<p>This bridging not only concerns individual destinies but also determines the sustainable development of Chinese society. Coordinated urban and rural development is not a one-way flow of resources but a symbiotic and complementary relationship. In the future, every child, whether born in a city or a village, should have the opportunity to enjoy equal resources and choices. The progress of society ultimately lies in the protection of individual freedom and dignity.</p>
