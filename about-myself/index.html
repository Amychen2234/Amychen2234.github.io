<h1>快乐的童年 - 外公外婆的陪伴 Happy Childhood - The Companionship of My Grandparents 7.2.2024 </h1>
<p>我出生的年代正值中国计划生育政策最严厉的时期。在“一胎政策”下，农村户口允许生两个女儿，于是我和姐姐得以合法出生。三年后，我的弟弟降临，带来了8000块的罚款，这笔钱成为了弟弟小时候的绰号，他叫“陈八千”。家里因超生的罚款和抚养三个孩子的经济压力变得更加拮据，所以我很小就被寄养在外公外婆家。</p>
<p>I was born during the period when China's family planning policy was at its strictest. Under the "One-Child Policy," rural households were allowed to have two daughters, which meant that my sister and I were legally born. Three years later, my brother came along, bringing with him an 8,000 yuan fine, which became his childhood nickname. The fine for exceeding the birth limit, along with the financial strain of raising three children, put even more pressure on the family, so I was sent to live with my grandparents since I was a kid.</p>
<p>我的童年几乎都是外公外婆带大的。小时候记得每次爸妈离开时，我都会大哭。或许是因为小小年纪就隐约感觉到自己在家里不是最被期待的那一个，所以从小我就特别懂事，察言观色的能力让我能让身边所有的大人开心。小学的时候，我成绩很好，总是能得到老师的表扬，还能拿奖学金。那时候看到外公外婆生活很辛苦，我会把奖学金和零花钱攒下来，过年的时候把一叠钞票交给外婆，想让她过得好一点。可外婆总是微笑着把钱还给我，还多给些钱给我当压岁钱，最后钱还是回到了我的手上。很多年之后回想起跟外公外婆之间的关系，这是我能感受到世界上最美好的关系之一。</p>
<p>My childhood was mostly spent with my grandparents. Each time my parents left, I would cry uncontrollably. Perhaps I sensed early on that I wasn’t the most expected one in the family, which led me to become well-behaved and develop a keen ability to read the emotions of the adults around me. In elementary school, I had good grades and often earned scholarships, which brought praise from my teachers. Seeing how hard life was for my grandparents, I saved up my scholarship money and allowance, handing it to my grandmother during the New Year, hoping it would make life easier for her. She would always smile, return the money, and even give me more as a gift, so the money inevitably found its way back to me. Looking back years later, I realize that my relationship with my grandparents remains one of the most beautiful connections I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>小时候，我特别喜欢学习和问问题。放学回家，我最期待的就是听外公讲故事。他最喜欢给我讲抗日战争的故事，我至今还能背诵他常提到的那句诗：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真。杀了夏明翰，还有后来人。”这句话让我明白了做人要有骨气，不能轻易屈服于威胁和恐吓。妈妈说外公年轻时脾气不好，但在我眼里，他从来没有对我发过火，反而一直对我非常慈爱。作为家中最小的外孙女，外公总是夸我聪明，每次见到我都会竖起大拇指。我们常常一起看新闻联播，临睡前他还会给我讲鬼故事，虽然是鬼故事，但却让我感到安心，伴我入睡。这些夜晚成了我童年最美好的回忆之一。外婆则是个寡言少语的人，常常坐在门口抽烟，望着远方。她熬的锅巴粥我至今念念不忘，那是乡下常见的食物，用剩饭在柴火下煎成锅巴，再加水碾碎煮成粥。有一次在纽约的一家韩国餐厅，我竟然找到了类似的锅巴，一瞬间泪湿眼眶。外婆喜欢把零食藏在米缸里，防止调皮的表哥们偷吃，等我放学回来，她会悄悄拿出来给我吃。冬天睡觉时，外婆总是帮我把被子盖得严严实实，那种温暖至今让我无比怀念。去年在心理咨询时，当被问到让我感到最安全的场景时，我第一时间想到的就是外公外婆家的小茅房的床，睡前外婆会确保我全身都被被子包裹好，外公会给我讲故事。虽然那里简陋，没有自来水和厕所，但那里有外公的故事和外婆的温暖，我总是睡得安稳。</p>
<p>As a child, I loved learning and asking questions. After school, I looked forward to my grandfather’s stories, especially those about the China-Japan War. I can still recite the line of poetry he often quoted: "Don’t fear beheading, as long as the cause is true. Kill Xia Minghan, and others will follow." This taught me the importance of integrity. My mother said he had a bad temper, but to me, he was always kind, often praising me as smart with a thumbs-up. We watched the news together, and his ghost stories helped me fall asleep, becoming some of my fondest memories. My grandmother was quiet, often sitting at the door smoking. Her pot rice porridge still lingers in my memory. Once, at a Korean restaurant in New York, I found a similar dish and was moved to tears. She used to hide snacks for me in the rice jar and would tuck me in tightly during winter nights, a warmth I still cherish. Last year in a therapy session, when asked where I felt the safest, the first place that came to mind was my grandparents’ old house. Despite its simplicity, it was filled with my grandfather’s stories and my grandmother’s warmth, where I always slept soundly.</p>
<p>我小学五年级时，表哥突然跑到教室告诉我，外婆去世了。当时年纪尚小，我还不太明白去世的真正意义，只觉得心里一片茫然。没有了外婆，外公也明显变得沉默了，往日的活力不再。我放学回家后，外公不再像以前那样给我讲故事或竖大拇指夸我。后来我转学到了城里，回家的次数越来越少，每次见到外公，我都会特意带些好吃的给他，但他总是显得郁郁寡欢。几年后，外公也病了，在他弥留之际，家族的人都聚在外公的家里。舅舅们一边抽烟一边讨论如何分外公的遗产，而外公奄奄一息地躺在床上。这一幕让我心里很痛，也让我对他们的冷漠感到愤怒。我不满他们在外公病重时还在吸烟，但当时我年纪太小，声音太弱，无法阻止大人们的行为。</p> 
<p>When I was in fifth grade, my cousin suddenly came to my classroom to tell me that my grandmother had passed away. At that young age, I didn’t fully grasp the meaning of death, only feeling a deep sense of confusion. Without my grandmother, my grandfather became noticeably more silent, his vitality gone. After school, he no longer told me stories or praised me with a thumbs-up like he used to. Later, I transferred to a school in the city and went home less frequently. Whenever I did visit, I would bring my grandfather some treats and food, but he always seemed downcast. A few years later, my grandfather fell ill, and during his final moments, the family gathered at his house. My uncles sat around, smoking and discussing how to divide his inheritance while he lay on his deathbed. That scene filled me with pain and anger at their indifference. I wanted to stop them from smoking while my grandfather was so ill, but I was too young and my voice too weak to influence the adults.</p>
<p>外公去世后，我跪在他和外婆的墓碑前，立下了人生的第一个誓言：我要出人头地，赚足够的钱，给他们修建一个体面的墓地回报他们对我的爱。</p>
<p>After my grandfather passed away, I knelt before his and my grandmother’s tombstone and made the first vow of my life: I would succeed, earn enough money, and build them a proper, dignified gravesite to repay them for the love they had given me.</p>  
<p>外公外婆没有受过教育，舅舅们和表哥表姐们也都没有好好读书，相继辍学。我成绩好，因此成了家族的希望，大家对我寄予了很大的期待。在外公外婆的关爱下，我得到了家庭、学校和邻居们的鼓励与支持。虽然家境贫寒，但在他们的爱护下，我的童年充满了温暖和阳光。如今，捉虾子、抓鱼、捡鸡蛋的无忧生活已成了过去，但那段与外公外婆共度的时光，依然是我最珍贵的回忆。</p>
<P>My grandparents were uneducated, and my uncles, aunts, and cousins all dropped out of school early. Because I excelled academically, I became the family's hope, and everyone had high expectations for me. Under the care of my grandparents, I received encouragement and support from family, school, and neighbors. Although we were poor, my childhood was filled with warmth and sunshine thanks to their love. The carefree days of catching shrimp, fishing, and collecting eggs are long gone, but the time spent with my grandparents remains my most cherished memory.</P> 

<h1>压抑的初中和家庭环境 - 叛逆的萌芽 Oppressive Middle School and Family Environment - The Emergence of Rebellion 7.3.2024</h1>
<p>当外公外婆相继去世后，我不得不回到父母身边，那时我已经上初中了。回到父母家的那一刻，仿佛生活一下子变得陌生和压抑。从一个充满关爱的环境回到父母家，我迅速意识到，这里和外公外婆家完全不同。妈妈性格暴躁，动不动就大吼大叫，只要稍有不如意，她就会立刻责骂我。相比之下，在外公外婆的家中，几乎没有人责怪我，我不知道自己做错了什么，只觉得莫名其妙的害怕。尽管我没有做错什么，我在家里的每一天都充满了小心翼翼。农忙时，我总是最卖力的那个；爸妈辛苦时，我会主动为他们按摩；当妈妈在店里忙时，我还会做好饭送去。即使在学校，我的成绩也一直名列前茅。然而，无论我多么努力，妈妈对我的批评和指责从未停止。这让我既困惑又感到不公平。正是在这个时候，我开始逐渐反抗。最初的反抗仅仅是通过提高音量顶嘴，但随着进入学校学习，我开始用学到的知识反驳她。初中生物课让我第一次理解了基因的概念，我突然意识到，也许父母并不是真的爱我，他们只是看我作为他们基因的延续，而对我的评价和对待仿佛是对待一件物品般随意。</p>
<p>When my grandparents passed away, I had no choice but to return to my parents' home. By then, I was already in middle school. The moment I stepped into my parents' house, life felt unfamiliar and suffocating. Coming from a loving environment, I quickly realized how different my parents' home was from my grandparents'. My mother had a volatile temper and often yelled at me. Any small displeasure would immediately result in her scolding me. In contrast, no one in my grandparents' home ever blamed me, and I didn’t know what I had done wrong. All I felt was an inexplicable fear. Even though I hadn’t done anything wrong, every day at home was filled with caution. During busy farming seasons, I worked the hardest; when my parents were exhausted, I offered them massages; and when my mother was busy in the store she worked for, I made meals and delivered them to her. Even at school, my grades were consistently top of the class. However, no matter how hard I tried, my mother's criticisms and scoldings never stopped. This left me feeling both confused and unfairly treated. It was during this time that I began to rebel. At first, my rebellion was just raising my voice in arguments, but as I learned more at school, I started to use the knowledge I gained to argue back. It was in middle school biology class that I first learned about the concept of genes. I suddenly realized that maybe my parents didn’t truly love me—they only saw me as a continuation of their genes, treating me like an object, evaluating me as if I were something they owned.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，妈妈的行为变得越来越过分。从公开羞辱我的外貌，到在亲戚面前批评我，再到撕毁我的课外书、扔掉我最喜欢的衣服，甚至当众读出我收到的情书，妈妈的控制欲愈发强烈。在全班同学面前，她甚至大吼让我退学，滚回家。这一切让我心中充满了愤怒与无助。在那个时刻，我14岁立下了人生的第二个誓言：我要离开这个家，越远越好，尽快赚足够的钱还清他们的养育费，然后与他们一刀两断。</p>
<p>Over time, my mother's behavior became increasingly extreme. From openly insulting my appearance, criticizing me in front of relatives, tearing up my extracurricular books, and throwing away my favorite clothes, to publicly reading out love letters boys sent to me, her need for control grew stronger. She even shouted at me in front of the entire class, telling me to drop out of school and go home. All of this filled me with anger and helplessness. At that moment, when I was 14, I made the second vow of my life: I would leave this home, as far away as possible, earn enough money to repay them for raising me, and then sever all ties with them.</p>
<p>而在这一切过程中，爸爸始终保持沉默。他默默劳作，从未站出来反对妈妈对我的教养方式。但我知道爸爸是爱我的，在我写作业的时候，他默默递过来的牛奶，打雷的时候送我上学，他从来不会指责我。但爸爸没有站出来保护我，我感到自己在这个家庭中孤立无援，没有人真正理解我。</p>
<p>Even though my father showed his love in small, quiet ways, like bringing me milk while I did my homework or walking me to school during storms, his silence in the face of my mother's harshness was incredibly difficult. It felt like those moments of care were overshadowed by the sense of being isolated and unsupported, with no one truly standing up for me or understanding my struggles.</p>
<p>尽管家庭的环境让我感到压抑，但在学校，我的生活截然不同。我成绩优秀，经常领奖，成为了“小小公众人物”。同学们的认可、老师的表扬让我在学校中找到了一丝自我价值。再加上性格活泼外向，初中时吸引了不少男生的关注，我经常收到情书和礼物。在男生们的钦慕与关注中，我仿佛找到了情感的出口，终于从家庭的压迫感中短暂解脱出来。初中这个阶段，我的叛逆意识逐渐萌芽。我不再盲目听从父母的指令，开始寻找属于自己的自由。偷偷谈恋爱不仅是我对抗家庭压抑的方式，也是一种自我探索的过程。</p>
<p>Despite the oppressive atmosphere at home, my life at school was completely different. I excelled academically, frequently won awards, and became somewhat of a “small public figure.” The recognition from my classmates and the praise from my teachers gave me a sense of self-worth. Additionally, with my bubbly and outgoing personality, I attracted the attention of many boys in middle school, often receiving love letters and gifts. In their admiration and attention, I found an emotional outlet, a brief escape from the pressures at home. During this phase, my rebellious spirit gradually began to emerge. I no longer blindly followed my parents' instructions and started seeking my own freedom. Secretly dating became not only a way for me to resist the oppression at home but also a process of self-exploration.</p>

  
<h1>姐弟三人的成长与家庭羁绊 The Growth of Three Siblings and Family Bonds 7.7.2024</h1>
<p>姐姐从小性格内敛，话不多，也不太喜欢表达自己。她继承了父亲的沉默和内敛，总是通过行动而不是言语来表达她的关心。15岁时，姐姐辍学去读了技术学校，随后前往沿海城市打工，成为一名“厂妹”。每次她从大城市回来，都会带回一些新衣服和小礼物，我对她的世界充满了好奇。姐姐的沉默让我感到她与家庭保持了一种距离，似乎对这个家里的争吵和压力都采取了回避的态度。尽管如此，她的默默奉献也展现了她对这个家的责任感。</p>
<p>My sister has been introverted since childhood, speaking little and not being one to express herself openly. She inherited our father’s quiet and reserved nature, always showing her care through actions rather than words. At 15, she dropped out of school to attend a technical school, and later went to work in a coastal city as a factory worker. Every time she returned from the city, she would bring back new clothes and small gifts, which made me curious about her world. Her silence gave me the sense that she kept a certain distance from the family, as if she was avoiding the conflicts and pressures at home. Nevertheless, her quiet dedication demonstrated her strong sense of responsibility towards the family.</p>
<p>弟弟从小在家里最受宠，作为家中唯一的儿子，父母尤其是妈妈对他格外关爱。小时候的他总是调皮捣蛋，但也因此特别黏我，和我关系非常亲近，但我发现我会因此欺负他，让他多做家务。他常常跟在我身边，虽然年纪小，却展现出对我的依赖与信任。尽管如此，弟弟并没有因此逃过高压的家庭，那时候因为去网吧玩游戏，也经常被骂被打。高一时，他辍学去学了厨艺，后来进入西藏部队。弟弟作为家里期待已久的男孩，承载着父母的期望，但他天性自由和好强，似乎总是在寻找逃离家庭束缚的方式。</p>
<p>My younger brother was the most spoiled in the family, especially as the only son, receiving a lot of attention from our parents, particularly our mother. As a child, he was always mischievous, which made him especially attached to me, and we were very close. However, I found myself taking advantage of that, making him do more chores. He was often by my side, and despite being younger, he showed a lot of trust and dependence on me. Nevertheless, he didn’t escape the pressures of our strict household, and he was often scolded or beaten for going to internet cafes to play games. In high school, he dropped out to learn culinary arts, and later, he joined the military in Tibet. As the long-awaited son of the family, he carried our parents' expectations, but his free-spirited and strong-willed nature seemed to always drive him to find ways to escape the constraints of the family.</p>
<p>作为家里的二女儿，我常觉得自己的存在感最弱。为了在这个竞争激烈的家庭中获得父母的注意和爱，我从小就学会了讨好父母和周围的人。我是家里最活泼外向的那个，擅长察言观色，尤其在亲戚面前，总是知道如何说些动听的话，表现得乖巧懂事。在家里，我承担了最多责任，我所做的一切都是为了证明自己有价值，能够被父母认可。即使在学校，我也努力保持成绩优异，希望借此获得更多的关注和爱。然而，我始终感受到家庭中的不公平，对比姐姐的沉默与弟弟的受宠，我常感到自己在这个家庭里既弱势又不被重视。</p>
<p>As the second daughter and middle child in the family, I often felt overlooked. To gain my parents' attention and love in such a competitive household, I learned from a young age to please my parents and those around me. I was the most bubbly and outgoing in the family, skilled at reading others' emotions, and always knew how to say the right things to appear obedient and well-behaved, especially in front of relatives. At home, I took on the most responsibilities, doing everything I could to prove my value and earn my parents' approval. Even at school, I worked hard to maintain excellent grades, hoping to gain more attention and love. However, I always felt the unfairness in the family dynamics—compared to my sister's silence and my brother being favored, I often felt neglected and undervalued in this family.</p>
<p>在这个家庭里，母亲的强势和暴躁让家里的氛围充满了压抑和紧张。父亲则沉默寡言，很少介入家庭事务，他的不作为加剧了家庭的失衡。姐姐、弟弟和我各自以不同的方式适应着这个不和谐的家庭。姐姐选择了沉默和退让，她通过行动表达对家庭的责任，却不愿卷入争吵。弟弟则因为是家中的宠儿，享受着特殊的待遇，同时也承载着父母的期望。而我则不断努力，通过获得独立和自由去更广阔的世界寻找我的生活，但在这场家庭的竞争中，我总觉得自己处于弱势。我们兄弟姐妹之间的关系，常常因为家庭资源的有限而充满竞争。每个人都在争夺父母的注意力和情感，这让我们的关系变得复杂而紧张。尽管如此，姐姐、弟弟和我始终保持着又爱又恨的关系，我们相互支持的同时，又会彼此埋怨和计较付出的多少。</p>
<p>In this family, my mother's strong and volatile nature filled the atmosphere with oppression and tension. My father, on the other hand, was quiet and rarely got involved in family matters, and his inaction only worsened the imbalance in our household. My sister, brother, and I each adapted to this disharmony in our own ways. My sister chose silence and compromise, showing her responsibility toward the family through her actions but avoiding conflict. My brother, being the favored child, enjoyed special treatment and also carried our parents' expectations. As for me, I worked hard, seeking independence and freedom in a broader world, yet I always felt at a disadvantage in this family competition. The relationship between us siblings was often strained due to the limited family resources, leading to competition for our parents' attention and affection. This made our relationships complex and tense. Nevertheless, my sister, brother, and I maintained a love-hate relationship, supporting one another while also harboring complaints and resentment about how much each of us contributed.</p>
  

<h1>家族中的长辈：奶奶，叔奶奶和叔爷爷，太奶奶 Elders in the Family: Grandmother, Great-Aunt, Great-Uncle, and Great-Grandmother 7.10.2024</h1>
<p>奶奶是个虔诚的基督徒，经历了丈夫早逝、独自抚养孩子的艰难岁月。爷爷去世后，她成了寡妇，带着三个孩子艰难前行。尽管她对邻里总是和和气气，但与妈妈的矛盾却非常尖锐。妈妈常常在我面前哭诉，指责奶奶重男轻女，还让我少与她亲近。多年以后我才意识到，妈妈的情感宣泄背后，隐藏着两代女性之间深深的伤痛和控制。奶奶是一个孤独的人，她经历过贫困和丧夫之痛，因为贫穷不得不把我叔叔送人，她内心的苦楚可能从未被真正理解。所以，在和奶奶视频通话时，我从她的自言自语中读出了她对家人团聚的渴望，以及对孤独生活的无奈。于是，我会抽时间认真听她说话，发自内心地赞美和认可她。</p>
<p>My grandmother was a devout Christian who endured the hardships of losing her husband early and raising children on her own. After my grandfather passed away, she became a widow, struggling to raise three children. Despite always being polite to the neighbors, she had a sharp conflict with my mother. My mother often cried in front of me, blaming my grandmother for favoring boys over girls and telling me to keep my distance from her. It wasn't until many years later that I realized my mother’s emotional outbursts were rooted in deep pain and control between two generations of women. My grandmother was a lonely person, having experienced poverty and the loss of her husband, and even had to give my uncle away due to financial hardship. Her inner suffering may have never been truly understood. During video calls with my grandmother, I could sense her longing for family reunions and her frustration with living in solitude. So, I made time to listen to her, offering genuine praise and acknowledgment.</p>
<p>叔爷爷是村里唯一的大学生，他的学识和智慧在家族中深受尊敬。叔奶奶是一位医生，夫妻俩住在城市的医院家属区，他们给了我从农村转学到城市的机会，我初三时从乡下转到了城里学校，部分原因是为了逃离家中的压抑氛围。我清楚地记得住在他们家时，叔爷爷和叔奶奶经常与我谈论他们年轻时的艰辛岁月以及人生的感悟。他们的故事充满了奋斗与牺牲的精神，也让我通过他们接触到了诗歌和文学。即使当时我住在客厅，没有自己的私人空间，但我非常珍惜与他们共度的时光。尽管我与叔爷爷叔奶奶的关系非常亲密，但发现他们与他们儿子一家却始终保持着距离。有一次，我目睹了叔叔对阿姨的暴力行为，这让我深感恐惧，但当时找不到倾诉的对象。寄人篱下，总要付出代价。后来，叔爷爷和叔奶奶相继生病，我常常在放学后照顾他们，甚至带着作业在病床边陪伴他们。后来，奶奶也搬了过来，一边照顾他们，一边照顾我。多年以后回想起来，我的成长与成就背后，离不开这几个老人的默默付出。</p>
<p>My granduncle was the only college graduate in the village, and his knowledge and wisdom were highly respected in our family. My grandaunt was a doctor, and they lived in the hospital housing complex in the city. They gave me the opportunity to transfer from a rural school to a city school in the ninth grade, partly as my initiative to escape the oppressive atmosphere at home. I clearly remember living with them and how they often talked to me about the hardships they faced in their youth and their life reflections. Their stories were filled with the spirit of struggle and sacrifice, and they also introduced me to poetry and literature. Even though I lived in the living room at the time and didn’t have my own private space, I cherished the time I spent with them. Although I had a very close relationship with my granduncle and grandaunt, I find that they always remained distant from their son’s family. Once, I witnessed my uncle's violent behavior toward my aunt, which terrified me, but I had no one to confide in. Living under someone else’s roof always comes with its own costs. Later, both my granduncle and grandaunt fell ill, and I often took care of them after school, sometimes even doing my homework by their bedside. Eventually, my grandmother moved in as well, helping to care for them and for me. Looking back, I realize that my growth and achievements wouldn’t have been possible without their quiet sacrifices.</p>
<p>读初中的时候，太奶奶年事已高，但在家族中却常被视为负担。尽管年迈，她仍需自己洗衣服，生活中的琐事无人替她分担。我常看到她独自坐在椅子上看着远方，眼神里流露出无法言说的孤独。那时候我会带好吃的给她，帮她提水，陪她说话解闷。有一次，太奶奶突然大哭，告诉我，我对她比她的女儿还好。多年后我才明白，那是她积攒的失落与委屈的爆发。她的哭泣不是偶然，而是长久以来被忽视的情感宣泄。在家族中，太奶奶的需求常常被忽略，没有谁真正投入时间与精力去关心她，而她内心的孤独和无助则是她沉默中最深的痛。</p>
<p>When I was in middle school, my great-grandmother was very old, but she was often seen as a burden within the family. Despite her age, she still had to wash her own clothes, and no one helped her with the small tasks of daily life. I often saw her sitting alone in a chair, staring into the distance, with an expression of unspeakable loneliness. At that time, I would bring her treats, help her carry water, and keep her company to ease her boredom. One day, my great-grandmother suddenly burst into tears and told me that I treated her better than her own daughter did - I did nothing! It was only years later that I realized her outburst was an expression of the accumulated sorrow and frustration she had been holding in. Her tears weren’t a one-time event, but rather a release of emotions that had been ignored for so long. In the family, her needs were often overlooked, and no one truly invested time or energy to care for her. Her deep loneliness and helplessness were the unspoken pain she carried in her silence.</p>
<p>无论是农村的老人还是城市的老人，他们都面临着共同的孤独感。尽管他们在生活条件上有所不同，农村的艰苦生活和城市的相对富足形成了鲜明的对比，但无论是太奶奶，还是叔爷爷叔奶奶，他们都经历着晚年生活中的情感缺失。农村老人在物质和情感上受到双重的压迫，而城市老人则在精神富足的背后，隐藏着难以言说的孤独。</p>
<p>Whether in rural or urban regions, elderly people face a shared sense of loneliness. Despite the differences in their living conditions—rural hardships contrasting sharply with the relative comfort of urban life—both my great-grandmother and my granduncle and grandaunt experienced emotional neglect in their later years. Rural elders suffer from both material and emotional deprivation, while urban elders, despite material wealth, hide an indescribable loneliness behind their apparent comfort.</p>
  
<h1>人生的转折点一：休学、工厂打工和转学省会私立学校 First Turning Point in Life: Dropping Out, Factory Work, and Transferring to a Private School in the Capital City 7.15.2024</h1>
<p>在高中的第一学期期中考试中，我考了全校第一。然而，从离开外公外婆家到上高中的这段时间让我感到压抑，再加上对学习的天赋，我开始怀疑学习的意义——为什么要读书？我反复问自己这个问题，但似乎没有人能给我一个满意的答案。于是，我对爸妈说，我想休学，不想再去学校了。一开始，父母以为我是在闹脾气，直到我真的停止去学校，他们才意识到我不是在开玩笑。家里的亲戚接连上门劝说我重新回学校读书，但没有一个人能说服我。最终，我决定通过假身份证去江苏投靠正在打工的姐姐。对于一个来自农村的年轻女孩来说，社会提供的选择极其有限。刚开始我在网吧做收银员，后来在服装店卖衣服，最后去了工厂打工。在短短不到半年的时间里，我深刻体会到了工厂生活的绝望。期间，我曾搭过陌生人的车，遭遇过男性的骚扰。相比学校，那是我第一次感受到人生的尽头，一种无处可逃的深深绝望。那段时间，我和姐姐住在一起。我们之间时常爆发冲突，每当我沉默抗议时，却遭遇姐姐的拳打脚踢。在这个陌生的城市里，我感受不到任何安全感或保护。于是，我决定回家。</p>
<p>During my first semester of high school, I ranked first in the entire school for the midterm exams. However, the pressure from leaving my grandparents’ home combined with my academic talent made me start questioning the purpose of studying—why should I continue with school? I kept asking myself this question, but no one seemed to have a satisfactory answer. So, I told my parents I wanted to drop out and no longer go to school. At first, they thought I was just being moody, but when I actually stopped going, they realized I was serious. Relatives came one after another, trying to convince me to return to school, but none of their reasons persuaded me. In the end, I decided to use a fake ID and go to Jiangsu, a province near Shanghai, where my sister was working. For a young girl from the countryside, the choices society offers are very limited. I first worked as a cashier at an internet cafe, then in a clothing store, and eventually ended up working in a factory. In less than six months, I fully experienced the despair of factory life. During that time, I even hitchhiked with strangers and faced harassment from men. Compared to school, this was my first time feeling the deep hopelessness of life—a dead end with no escape. During that period, I lived with my sister, and we often had conflicts. When I silently protested, she responded with physical abuse. In this unfamiliar city, I felt no sense of safety or protection, so I decided to return home.</p>
<p>由于之前成绩一直很好，加上家里叔叔在农村的高中任教，他们愿意重新接纳我，并提供了全额奖学金。我再次开始了高一的课程，但一切对我来说都太容易了。期中考试时，我又轻松考了第一。因为成绩出众，我对老师并不放在眼里。化学课上，我经常挑战老师，按照自己的想法提问。一次，化学老师在课堂上公开羞辱我，具体说了什么我已经忘了，但当时的我血气方刚，愤然背起书包，扬言再也不上他的课，直接冲出教室，甚至突破门卫的阻拦，回了家。后来，学校为了挽留我，提出各种优待条件，包括继续提供奖学金、党员资格，甚至还为我安排了一间教室旁的私人休息室。但那时我心意已决。我在网吧里查找长沙的学校，一个个打电话询问是否接收转学生。我特别想读长沙外国语学校，叔叔带我去了省会，但因为我们没有任何背景或资源，碰了一鼻子灰。后来，我们联系到了一所私立学校，他们破例允许我参加入学考试。考试中，我的数学和英语成绩非常好。当时我很大胆亲自跟主任协商，家里无法负担学费，希望他们能提供全额奖学金。令人意外的是，他们答应了这个请求，给了我全额奖学金。</p>
<p>Due to my previous strong academic performance, and the fact that my uncle was a teacher at a rural high school, the school was willing to take me back and offered me a full scholarship. I started my first year of high school again, but everything was too easy for me. At the midterm exams, I once again easily ranked first. Because of my outstanding grades, I didn’t take the teachers seriously. In chemistry class, I often challenged the teacher, asking questions on my own terms. One day, the chemistry teacher publicly humiliated me in class—though I can’t remember the exact words, my hot-headed younger self packed my bag in anger, swore I would never attend his class again, and stormed out of the classroom, even bypassing the guards at the school gate to go home. Later, the school tried to persuade me to stay by offering various incentives, including continuing the scholarship, offering me a spot in the Communist Party, and even providing a private rest room next to the classroom. However, by that time, my mind was made up. I started looking up schools in Changsha, the capital city, at an internet cafe, calling each one to see if they accepted transfer students. I was particularly eager to attend Changsha Foreign Language School, so my uncle took me to the capital city. But because we had no connections or resources, we were turned away. Eventually, we contacted a private school, and they made an exception, allowing me to take their entrance exam. I performed very well in both math and English. Boldly, I negotiated directly with the head of the school, explaining that my family couldn’t afford the tuition and requesting a full scholarship. To my surprise, they granted my request and offered me a full scholarship.</p>
<p>这所私立学校带给我全新的体验。班级人数不多，同学们之间关系紧密，学校也提供了很多支持。一开始我有些不合群，生物老师察觉到后，贴心地问我是不是想家了，她的温柔关怀让我感受到了一种久违的温暖，仿佛回到了外公外婆的家。高中的时光算是我比较快乐的一段时期。我交了许多朋友，由于校服的统一，很难看出彼此的贫富差距，大家也没有因为经济条件不同而排斥对方，许多我现在的亲密朋友都是那时候认识的，但再愉快的高中再面临高考的时候也是压力重重。高中时，我第一次接触到外教。我的英语非常好，自然而然地主动和他们聊天。他们的表达方式、游历经验和思想深深吸引了我，从那时起，我开始渴望有一天能探索全世界，甚至希望能有机会出国留学。于是，我在高中的时候开始给许多英国和美国的学校写信，然而大部分信都没有得到回复。多年以后，再次读到当年那些邮件，我看到了那个曾经绝望的自己，她是多么渴望去一个自由、充满温情的地方，因为她的成长环境与此相反。从离开外公外婆家后，她几乎再也没有找到一个让她感到安全的地方。</p>
<p>This private school gave me a completely new experience. The class sizes were small, and the students were closely bonded. The school also offered a lot of support. At first, I struggled to fit in, but my biology teacher noticed and gently asked if I was homesick. Her warmth and kindness gave me a sense of comfort I hadn’t felt in a long time, reminding me of the warmth I experienced at my grandparents’ home. High school was a relatively happy time for me. I made many friends, and since everyone wore uniforms, it was hard to distinguish between different economic backgrounds. No one was judged based on their financial status, and many of my close friends today are from that period. However, no matter how enjoyable high school was, the pressure of preparing for the college entrance exam was overwhelming. During high school, I met foreign teachers for the first time. My English was excellent, so I naturally initiated conversations with them. I was deeply fascinated by their way of expressing themselves, their travel experiences, and their ideas. From that point on, I began to yearn for the opportunity to explore the world, and I dreamed of studying abroad. So, I started writing letters to schools in the UK and the US while still in high school, though most of them went unanswered. Years later, as I reread those emails, I saw the desperation in my younger self. She was so eager to find a place filled with freedom and warmth, a stark contrast to the environment she grew up in. </p>

<h1>人生转折点二：大学、Coursera和美国 Second Turning Point in Life: University, Coursera, and the United States 8.12.2024</h1>
<p>高考的失利让我重新审视自己的未来，高中毕业后，我在长沙兼职卖康宝莱，街头发传单。在这段时间里，我学会了如何与不同的人打交道，如何销售，也第一次接触到了保健品行业。当填志愿的时候，尽管周围人给了很多建议，但我无视了那些声音，而是独自去了长沙的图书馆，在那里待了整整一周，认真研究了各个专业。大多数人认为我应该选择英语专业，但我知道英语我可以自学，不需要作为专业来学习。最终，我选中了两个我认为更具前景的方向：计算机和生物工程。然而，计算机并没有引起我的兴趣，而康宝莱的经历让我意识到，生物工程可能是一个极具潜力的领域。</p>
<p>Failing the college entrance exam made me reevaluate my future. After graduating from high school, I took a part-time job in Changsha, selling Herbalife and handing out flyers on the streets. During this time, I learned how to interact with different people and gained my first experience in sales, as well as an introduction to the health supplement industry. When it came to choosing my college major, despite receiving a lot of advice from those around me, I ignored those voices and instead spent a whole week at the largest library in Hunan, researching different fields. Most people thought I should choose English as my major, but I knew I could learn English on my own without needing to pursue it academically. In the end, I narrowed it down to two promising options: Computer Science and Bioengineering. However, I wasn't particularly interested in Computer Science, and my experience with Herbalife made me realize that Bioengineering could be a field with great potential.</p>
<p>带着“离家越远越好”的念头，我选择了一所北方的大学寻找到了同伴前往。在大学的第一个学期，很快我就发现，大家最关心的是谈恋爱、学生会、实习，几乎没人真的在乎学习。于是，我逐渐远离了社交，开始泡在图书馆，把书从A到Z都翻了一遍，慢慢筛选出了自己感兴趣的领域：文化、语言、社会科学、哲学、心理学、文学和政治。</p>
<p>Driven by the thought of "the farther from home, the better," I chose a university in northern China (vs my hometown in the South) and found a few companions to take the train to university. In my first semester, I quickly realized that most of my peers were more interested in dating, joining the student union, or getting internships. Hardly anyone seemed to care about studying. So, I gradually distanced myself from socializing and began spending most of my time in the library. I started going through books from A to Z, gradually narrowing down the areas that interested me the most: culture, language, social sciences, philosophy, psychology, literature, and politics.</p>
<p>寒暑假，我加入了姐夫开的一家教育培训机构，从助教、发传单到策划夏令营，我的工作经验逐渐丰富，在同龄人里收入算比较高的，也很快经济独立了。这段时间里，我不仅学会了如何在职场打拼，还学会了如何合理规划自己的钱，用这些资源去丰富自己的见识，去不同的城市旅行。大学期间，我的时间几乎都在图书馆或工作中度过，这让我在没有经济压力的情况下，能够自由地探索知识和生活。</p>
<p>During winter and summer breaks, I joined my brother-in-law's education startup company, where I worked in teaching, sales, and course design. My work experience gradually grew, and I became financially independent earlier than most of my peers. This period taught me not only how to navigate the workplace but also how to manage my money effectively, using my resources to broaden my horizons and travel to different cities. Throughout college, my time was mostly spent between the library and work while travelling, which allowed me to explore knowledge and life freely without the burden of financial stress.</p>
<p>大三时，我逐渐对大学的课堂和图书馆失去了兴趣。于是，我开始转向线上课程，沉浸于TED演讲、Coursera和网易公开课等平台，学习了从哈佛的《幸福课》和《正义》到耶鲁的《金融市场》等课程。其中，我在Coursera上报名了一门名为《如何改变世界》的课程。对于一个来自中国农村的女孩来说，“改变世界”这个概念显得有些不切实际。我最初带着质疑和好奇的态度参加了这门课，但没想到，它最终意外地改变了我的人生轨迹。</p>
<p>In my junior year of college, I gradually lost interest in traditional lectures and spending time in the library. I began to shift my focus to online courses, immersing myself in platforms like TED Talks, Coursera, and NetEase Open Courses. I took classes ranging from Harvard's "Happiness" and "Justice" course to Yale's "Financial Markets" courses. Among them, I enrolled in a Coursera course titled "How to Change the World." As a girl from a rural village in China, the idea of "changing the world" seemed somewhat unrealistic to me. I initially joined the course with a sense of skepticism and curiosity, but to my surprise, it ended up unexpectedly altering the trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>课程中，老师讲授了全球性问题、社会不平等和可持续发展等话题，这些与我个人的生活很格格不入。这堂课的意外来自于，我结识了一位对中国充满兴趣的英国人C。最初，我们的交流仅限于我分享作为中国大学生的郁闷，他分享他对世界的见解。尽管他有时显得有些古怪，但我渐渐发现，C的知识和视野为我打开了一扇从未想象过的大门。他向我介绍了全球范围内的资源网络，从联合国到世界银行，他时常谈及那些对全球产生深远影响的项目和人物。大学的生活过于平淡和乏味，而他描述的那个广阔世界让我充满了兴趣和向往。</p>
<p>In the course, the professor covered topics such as global issues, social inequality, and sustainable development, which felt quite disconnected from my own life experiences. The unexpected part of this course came when I met a British man named C, who had a deep interest in China. Initially, our conversations revolved around me sharing the frustrations of being a Chinese university student and him offering his insights on the world. Although he sometimes came across as a bit eccentric, I gradually realized that C’s knowledge and worldview opened a door for me that I had never imagined before. He introduced me to global networks, from the United Nations to the World Bank, frequently discussing projects and individuals that had a profound impact on the world. University life had become monotonous and dull, but the expansive world he described sparked my curiosity and sense of adventure.</p>
<p>在大学快要毕业的时候，C邀请我参加世界儿童艺术节，并且愿意赞助我所有的费用。这个机会来得非常突然，完全出乎我的意料，但我的直觉告诉我，这次机会无论如何都不应该错过。作为一个从中国农村走出来的女孩，能够亲自踏上美国的土地，是我一直以来的梦想。后来，我站在华盛顿特区的街头，看到这座城市的关于环境保护、教育改革和人权的宣传，内心深受震撼。我忽然意识到，这不正是我一直在寻找的那个充满公正与美好的世界吗？</p>
<p>As I was nearing my college graduation, C invited me to attend the World Children's Arts Festival and offered to sponsor all of my expenses. This opportunity came completely out of the blue, and I was taken by surprise. However, my instincts told me that this was an opportunity I simply couldn't pass up. As a girl from a rural village in China, stepping foot on American soil had always been a distant dream of mine. Later, as I stood on the streets of Washington, D.C., looking at the city's campaigns on environmental protection, educational reform, and human rights, I was deeply moved. Suddenly, I realized that this was the ideal world I had been searching for—a world filled with fairness and beauty.</p>
<p>毕业后，我回到国内继续在我姐夫的教育机构工作，负责海外业务。我以为与C的合作已经结束，但他再次联系我，邀请我到美国参与一系列研究项目，承诺的薪水远高于我现有的机会。尽管迟疑，但之前对C的印象比较好，他很奇怪但人不坏，所以我又来了美国。刚开始的日子里，C带我参加各种国际活动，从世界银行到联合国，甚至走访了迪拜和孟加拉。我接触到了许多全球精英，C也对我寄予厚望，希望我能成为“改变中国”的象征。然而，作为一个20多岁的农村女生，这让我感到困惑。</p>
<p>After graduating, I returned to China and continued working at my brother-in-law's education company, handling the overseas business. I thought my collaboration with C had come to an end, but he reached out again, inviting me to the U.S. to join several research projects, offering a salary far higher than what I was earning. I hestitated but still gladly accepted as I sensed that he was not a bad guy. In the beginning, C took me to various global events, from the World Bank to the United Nations, and even to places like Dubai and Bangladesh. I was introduced to influential people from around the world, and C had high hopes for me, believing I could become a representative figure of "changing China." As a young woman from a rural background, I felt both honored but confused.</p>
<p>随着时间推移，我逐渐意识到自己并没有真正融入这些场合，更多时候我只是C展示的一个符号。虽然接触了很多重要人物，但我的声音却得不到重视。慢慢地，我明白C并没有真正让我参与这些项目，他更多是把我当作某种象征。与此同时，我们之间的分歧日益加深。我渴望真正参与和学习，贡献我的见解，而C却坚持让我扮演他设想中的角色。他的期望让我感到压力越来越大，也让我觉得自己被束缚。</p>
<p>However, as time passed, I realized I wasn’t truly part of these circles. Instead, I felt like a symbol that C was showcasing. I met many significant figures, but my voice wasn’t being heard. Gradually, it became clear that C was more interested in using me as a representation rather than allowing me to genuinely contribute. Our differences grew. I wanted to engage more deeply, to learn and offer my insights, but C insisted that I fit into the role he had envisioned. The expectations he placed on me felt overwhelming, and I started to feel trapped.</p>
<p>最终，我决定退出C的项目，追求自己独立的发展方向。这段经历让我看到了国际舞台的广阔，但真正的成长源于自己的选择和坚持，而不是依赖外界赋予的光环。我不再愿意作为他人展示的工具，而是渴望掌控自己的命运。这不仅是我与C的分歧，更是我与自己内心需求的对抗。</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to leave C’s projects and pursue my own path. Looking back, while this experience gave me exposure to the broader international stage, I realized that true growth comes from my own decisions and determination, not from being placed in someone else’s spotlight. I no longer wanted to be a tool for someone else's agenda; I wanted control over my own destiny. Leaving C wasn’t just about our conflict; it was about confronting my own inner needs. This experience taught me that real opportunities come from inner drive, not from relying on the labels others assign to you.</p>

  
  <h1>人生转折点三：哥大&哥大毕业之后的现实转折 Turning Point Three: Columbia University & Post-Graduation Reality 9.1.2024</h1>
  <p>离开C之后，我不得不独自探索未来的出路，我的前男友在我人生的第三个转折点发挥了重要作用。作为同龄人，他不仅在精神上给予了我极大的支持，还不断鼓励我独立思考，走自己的路。</p>
  <p>After parting ways with C, I was forced to navigate my future path on my own. My ex-boyfriend played a significant role in this third turning point of my life. As a peer, he not only provided me with tremendous emotional support but also continually encouraged me to think independently and pursue my own path.</p>
  <p>申请哥大是我人生中的又一次重要抉择。前男友普林斯顿毕业，他鼓励我大胆申请那些顶尖的学校，尽管我对自己是否有能力进入哥大以及能否承担高昂的学费感到不安，但他始终相信我的潜力。并且很感动的是，他在我考试的时候亲自送我去考场，在他的鼓励和支持下，我参考了他的申请材料，认真准备了自己的申请。出乎意料的是，我不仅得到了哥大的录取通知书，还得到了其他几所顶尖学校的邀请。在择校和专业的时候，前男友再次介绍我跟他以前的同学认识，帮我了解不同学校的优劣势。最终，我选择了哥大，这对我来说是一个巨大的肯定和机遇。</p>
  <p>Applying to Columbia University was another significant decision in my life. My ex-boyfriend, who had graduated from Princeton, encouraged me to boldly apply to top-tier schools. Although I felt uncertain about my ability to get into Columbia and whether I could afford the high tuition, he always believed in my potential. What touched me the most was that he personally accompanied me to the exam on test day. With his encouragement and support, I reviewed his application materials and carefully prepared my own. To my surprise, not only did I receive an acceptance letter from Columbia, but I was also accepted by several other prestigious schools. During the process of choosing a school and a program, my ex-boyfriend introduced me to his former classmates to help me better understand the strengths and weaknesses of different institutions. Ultimately, I chose Columbia, which felt like a huge validation and an incredible opportunity for me.</p>
  <p>进入哥大后，挑战接踵而至。高昂的学费让我感到极大的焦虑。从申请开始，我就没打算寻求家人的帮助，因为我不想增加他们的负担，也知道他们无力负担。前男友是唯一无偿给予我经济帮助的人，他在我入学时给了我几千美元，帮助我完成学业，而其余的费用全靠我自己赚取。从为中国学生撰写申请文书、带领游学团，到尝试区块链和加密货币，我想尽一切办法赚钱。学业上，从生物工程转型到国际关系也十分艰难，我在本科的人文科学的阅读和网上学习的内容完全不够，但最终，我克服了这些困难。毕业时，我银行卡里仅剩几千美元，但我没有任何债务。这对我来说是一种胜利的象征，因为我挺过了所有的艰难困苦。</p>
  <p>After entering Columbia, challenges quickly followed. The high tuition fees caused me immense anxiety. From the start, I never planned to seek financial help from my family, as I didn’t want to burden them and knew they couldn’t afford it. My ex-boyfriend was the only person who offered me financial support, giving me a few thousand dollars when I started school to help me complete my studies. The rest of the money, I earned through my own efforts. From writing application essays for Chinese students, leading study tours, to taking risk in the highly lucrative blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, I tried every possible way to make money. Academically, transitioning from bioengineering to international relations was extremely challenging. The humanities readings from my undergraduate studies and the online courses I had taken were far from sufficient, but I managed to overcome these difficulties. By the time I graduated, I had only a few thousand dollars left in my bank account, but I had no debt. To me, this was a symbol of victory because I had endured and overcome all the hardships.</p>
  <p>2019年毕业后的现实更加残酷，作为国际学生，没有签证几乎意味着找不到工作。我一边同时兼顾2-3份兼职和实习，还要不断地面试和参加coffee chats。整整八个月，我只收到了三个offer，但幸运的是，我在新冠疫情爆发前成功获得工作机会还有拿到了H1B工作签证。我的第一份工作门槛较低，但我凭借出色的表现，在业绩上做到了公司最佳，每次都有晋升机会。</p>
  <p>The reality after graduating in 2019 was even harsher. As an international student, not having a visa almost meant being unable to find a job. I juggled 2-3 part-time jobs and internships simultaneously while constantly interviewing and attending coffee chats. For eight long months, I only received three offers, but fortunately, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I successfully secured a job and obtained an H1B work visa. My first job had a low entry barrier, but I consistently performed exceptionally well, ranking as the top performer in the company, and I was offered promotions regularly.</p>
  <p>到了2021-2022年，我意识到是时候换工作了。那段时间，我阅读了大量关于美国职场规则的书籍，深入学习如何在顶尖公司争取到面试机会。通过这些学习和努力，我最终获得了梦寐以求的投资研究岗位。我原本以为，经过多年的拼搏与挣扎，工作会给我带来应有的认可、成就感和满足感。然而，我在工作中的长期过度投入，给自己施加了远超常规的压力，再加上我在身份认同上的撕裂感让我疲惫不堪。一方面，我很难在中国留学生群体中找到归属感；另一方面，为了在美国本土文化中立足，我不得不拼命融入职场文化而忽视了支持性的关系。再加上新冠疫情期间的隔离，以及多年未能回家的现实，纽约的恋爱友谊的挫折，这些因素让我内心早已满目疮痍。最终，我发现自己逐渐失去了与他人建立信任和维系关系的能力。第一次来华盛顿的时候，宣扬着“公平”和“正义”的口号的这座城市本以为是我一直在追寻的理想世界。然而，当我后来从纽约搬来华盛顿工作时，光鲜的表面逐渐剥落，我看到了这座城市更为冰冷的一面。那些关于正义的标语依然伫立在街道两旁，但它们仿佛已经失去了原有的力量。人们穿着昂贵的西装，行走在权力的象牙塔中，谈论着政策和改革，但内心却早已麻木。会议室里，高谈阔论的声音响彻耳边，仿佛所有的讨论都只是为了维持某种虚伪的表象。街道看起来依旧光亮，但在这背后，我感受到的是一股无形的冷漠。我开始厌恶这座城市，那些曾经让我心动的宣传如今看起来只是一层薄薄的面具，掩盖着真实的权力游戏和利益交换。</p>
  <p>By 2021-2022, I realized it was time to change jobs. During that period, I read extensively about the U.S. job market, learning how to secure interview opportunities with top companies. Through this learning and effort, I eventually landed a dream role in investment research. Initially, I thought that after years of hard work and struggle, my job would finally bring me the recognition, sense of achievement, and fulfillment I had been seeking. However, the constant overwork i invested, extreme pressure I put on myself, and the sense of identity fragmentation left me extremely burned out. On one hand, I found it difficult to find a sense of belonging within the Chinese international student community; on the other hand, I felt I had to work tirelessly to integrate into American corporate culture just to survive while I neglected building my support network. The isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with years of being away from home, as well as difficulty in dating and friendship in NYC, further deepened the emotional strain. In the end, I realized that I had gradually lost the ability to build trust and maintain meaningful relationships with others. I felt extremely lonely and isolated. When I first arrived in Washington DC, a city that promoted slogans of "fairness" and "justice," I thought I had finally found the ideal world I had been searching for. However, when I later moved from New York to Washington for finance work, the polished facade gradually peeled away, revealing a much colder reality. Those slogans about justice still stood along the streets, but they seemed to have lost their original force. People in expensive suits strolled through the ivory towers of power, discussing policies and reforms, yet their hearts seemed numb. In the meeting rooms, the sound of grand speeches echoed, as if all the discussions were merely maintaining some kind of false pretense. The streets still looked bright and pristine, but beneath it all, I could feel an invisible coldness. I began to loathe this city—what once stirred my heart now seemed like a thin mask, hiding the true games of power and the exchange of interests.</p>
  <p>那段时间，我常常回想起大学时期在工厂打工的经历，当初的那种无助与绝望感，没想到在多年努力进入美国精英圈后依然如影随形。通过资本家的视角，我看清了底层人几乎没有上升机会的现实。我开始对自己所学的国际关系感到厌恶，甚至对自己产生了强烈的否定。我曾经信仰的正义与美好，现在看来不过是精英们操控权力的游戏，而普通人只是这场游戏中的棋子，被他们肆意摆布。在最绝望的时刻，我甚至动过念头，买一张去南极的单程票，逃离这个让我感到窒息的世界。表面上看，我似乎已经获得了很多——常青藤的学历、不错的存款，但实际上我失去了更多：信念、希望、梦想，甚至是爱。我在富有与权势的圈子中游走，同时也见证了社会最底层的苦难，慢慢意识到，我追求的那个理想世界或许根本不存在。曾经我以为，家是让我痛苦的源头，于是下定决心离家拼搏多年，与父母相处的时间屈指可数。然而，最终得到的，却像是一件华而不实的奢侈品，外表光鲜，却无法填补内心的空虚，外部的世界比家庭更糟糕。</p>
  <p>During that time, I often recalled my experience working in a factory during college. The helplessness and sense of despair I felt back then, I never imagined would still follow me even after years of striving to enter the elite circles of America. Through the eyes of the capitalists, I saw the harsh reality that people at the bottom have almost no chance of rising. I began to resent the international relations I had studied, and even started to deeply question and reject myself. What I once believed to be ideals of justice and goodness now seemed like nothing more than power games controlled by the elite, with ordinary people merely being pawns manipulated at will. At my lowest point, I even considered buying a one-way ticket to Antarctica to escape this suffocating world. On the surface, it appeared that I had gained a lot—an Ivy League education, a decent amount of savings—but in truth, I had lost much more: my faith, hope, dreams, and even love. I drifted among the wealthy and powerful, while also witnessing the struggles of those at the very bottom of society, slowly realizing that the ideal world I had been pursuing might not exist at all. I once thought that home was the source of my pain, so I resolved to leave and fight for my own future, spending only a handful of years with my parents over the course of many. But in the end, what I gained felt like an empty luxury—glittering on the outside, but unable to fill the void within.</p>
  <p>我终于明白，真正的力量并不来自冰冷的逻辑和外部成就，而是源于内心深处的信念和爱。美国让我失望了，但我开始相信，自己有能力去实现内心的愿景，创造一个更加公平、充满关爱的社会。虽然“改变世界”听起来遥不可及，但我明白，我的任务并不是改变整个世界，而是首先改变自己，并在这个过程中对身边的人产生积极的影响。最终，我意识到，我一直在追寻的那些美好品质——勇气、坚持、同理心、坚韧与不屈服，其实一直都在我身上。</p>
  <p>I finally understand that true strength doesn't come from cold logic and external validation, but from the belief and love deep within the heart. America disappointed but, but I began to trust that I have the ability to realize my inner vision and create a more just and compassionate environment. While "changing the world" may seem like an unattainable goal, I’ve come to realize that my task is not to change the entire world but to start by changing myself, and through that, positively impact those around me. Ultimately, I discovered that the qualities I had been searching for—courage, persistence, empathy, resilience, and perseverance—were within me all along.</p>
  <p>现在，我对物质和地位的追求丧失了动机。我曾经被名牌服饰、豪华公寓和顶级餐厅的生活吸引，但真正让我感到幸福的，是穿着舒适的衣服，与家人朋友在一起的时光，还有湖南菜带来的那份熟悉感。那些我曾经以为非常重要的东西，如今看来都不再那么重要了。我知道，在未来的十年里，我会继续走一条与众不同的道路。尽管这条路的具体方向尚未明朗，但我相信，它会引领我走向一个更加美好的未来。</p>
  <p>Now, material pursuits and social status no longer hold me back. I was attracted to the luxury of designer clothes, high-end apartments, and fine dining, but what truly brings me joy is wearing comfortable clothes, spending time with family and friends, and the familiar taste of Hunan cuisine. The things I once thought were important have lost their significance. I know that in the next ten years, I will continue to walk a unique path. Though the specific direction of this journey is still unclear, I trust that it will lead me to an even brighter future.</p>

  <h1>在冲突中寻找平衡：个人成长、责任与社会矛盾 Finding Balance in Conflict: Personal Growth, Responsibilities, and Social Contradictions 9.17.2024</h1>
  <p>在外公外婆身边度过的童年，是我人生中唯一感受到无条件爱的时光。外婆的锅巴粥、外公的鬼故事，那些夜晚的温暖让我明白了什么是被爱和被关怀。然而，外公外婆的逝世标志着这种温暖的终结。母亲的严厉和冷漠、父亲的沉默和无作为、与兄弟姐妹间的竞争和利己，让我在一个本该充满关怀的环境中感到深深的孤独和压抑。我通过成绩和懂事，试图赢得父母的认可，但无论如何努力，回应我的始终是苛责与不满。这种情感的缺失与爱的稀缺，不仅是很多家庭内部矛盾的表象，它也映射了社会对成功与物质的过度追求所带来的情感空洞。在家庭内部的压抑中，我意识到，爱和支持并非天生由血缘保障，而是容易在成就和期待的压力下被牺牲。这种内心的痛苦是我后来不断追寻稳定情感和关系的根源，也是我逐渐领悟到，真正的爱并不是通过努力和成绩换来的，而是源自人与人之间最纯粹的信任与关怀。</p>
  <p>My childhood spent with my grandparents was the only time in my life when I truly felt unconditional love. My grandmother's pot rice porridge and my grandfather's ghost stories—those warm nights taught me what it meant to be loved and cared for. However, the passing of my grandparents marked the end of that emotional safety net. My mother's harshness and coldness, my father's silence and passivity, and the competition and self-interest among my siblings left me feeling profoundly lonely and stifled in an environment that should have been filled with care. I tried to earn my parents' approval through academic success and obedience, but no matter how hard I tried, all I received in return was criticism and dissatisfaction. This lack of emotional connection and scarcity of love is not only a reflection of the conflicts within many families; it also mirrors the emotional void created by society's excessive pursuit of success and material wealth. Amid the oppressive dynamics at home, I came to realize that love and support are not inherently guaranteed by blood ties but are easily sacrificed under the pressure of achievement and expectation. This internal pain became the root of my later pursuit of stable relationships and emotional security. It also led me to understand that true love is not earned through effort and accomplishments but is born from the purest trust and care between individuals.</p>
  <p>我的人生起点，是中国农村的一个普通的家庭。从早年寄养在外公外婆家，到后来的工厂打工，我始终在体验底层社会的无力与无奈。工厂的生活让我第一次看清了底层人在社会机制下的弱势地位，即使付出再多的努力，阶层的固化让上升的机会变得微乎其微。在这样的环境里，我看到了无数工人被压迫的命运，他们为生计疲于奔命，却永远无法真正掌控自己的未来。这种无力感贯穿了我从乡村到城市的旅程，也让我开始思考，个人的努力是否真的可以撼动阶层的壁垒。然而，进入精英阶层后，我感受到的并不是如期的满足与安全，反而是一种深刻的空虚和冷漠。在资本的世界里，许多人追求的是对权力的绝对掌控，但这种追逐却让他们失去了对人性和自我需求的敏感。我看到了那些在名利场中成功的人，内心空洞、关系疏离，似乎越是追求成功，越是感到孤独。权力和财富并没有带来真正的满足，反而让他们在人际关系中变得更加冷漠。这种表面的强大与内在的空虚，形成了极大的反差，也让我反思，究竟什么是真正的成功？在底层，我目睹的是无数人的无力与挣扎；在上层，我看见的是过度追求物质和权力的迷失与孤独。这种阶层间的矛盾，既让我对底层的困境感同身受，也让我对上层精英世界的虚无有了更深刻的理解。两个世界的痛苦本质相似，只是表现形式不同，前者是对命运的无力，后者是对意义和情感的迷失。</p>
  <p>My life began in a humble rural family in China. From being raised by my grandparents to working in a factory, I have always experienced the powerlessness and despair of the lower class. Factory life made me realize the disadvantaged position of those at the bottom of society, where no amount of effort seemed to break through the rigid barriers of class. I witnessed countless workers trapped in a cycle of survival, unable to truly control their futures. This sense of helplessness accompanied me on my journey from the countryside to the city, making me question whether individual effort can truly overcome structural inequalities. However, after entering the elite class, I did not find the fulfillment and security I expected. Instead, I was met with profound emptiness and indifference. In the world of capitalism, many chase absolute control over power, sometimes in the disguise under the name of love and higher personal goals, but this pursuit numbs them to human connection and personal needs. I saw those who had succeeded in the game of wealth and status, yet they remained hollow inside, with distant relationships—success seemed to amplify their loneliness. Power and wealth did not bring true satisfaction, but rather deepened their emotional detachment. This stark contrast between external strength and internal emptiness led me to question what real success truly means. Among the lower class, I saw endless struggles and helplessness, while among the upper class, I witnessed a loss of meaning and emotional isolation. The pain is the same at both levels—one is rooted in the futility of fate, the other in the emptiness of material and power-driven lives.</p>
  <p>作为一名在中国农村长大的孩子，我从小接受的是集体主义教育。在外公外婆家，我学会了依赖和关爱他人，感受到家庭与社区的温暖和归属感。然而，当我进入西方文化后，所遇到的却是极强的个人主义，尤其是在精英阶层。西方文化无限放大个人的力量，成就自我成为了人生的核心目标。然而，这种对个人主义的极端追求，反而削弱了人与人之间的情感联系和忽视作为人的基本需求。孤独和疏离成为了很多人的内在状态，他们试图用消费、成功和知识堆砌出虚假的堡垒，掩盖内心的空虚。这种文化冲突让我深刻感受到矛盾：东方文化中的依赖与关怀给予我情感上的安全感，而西方文化中的独立与自由则赋予了我追求自我发展的动力。游走在这两者之间，我既享受到西方自由带来的个人力量，也意识到过度的独立可能导致对他人依赖和谦卑能力的丧失。西方社会虽物质富足，但情感上却常常贫瘠，许多人在孤独中挣扎。这种文化上的撕裂，不仅让我反思个人主义的局限性，也让我更加珍视东方文化中那种深层次的人际联系与情感依赖。</p>
  <p>As someone growing up in rural China, I was raised with a strong sense of collectivism. Living with my grandparents, I learned to depend on and care for others, feeling the warmth and belonging that comes from family and community. However, when I adopted Western culture, particularly among the elite, I encountered an intense form of individualism. Western culture amplifies personal power, making self-fulfillment the ultimate goal. Yet this extreme pursuit of individualism often weakens emotional connections between people and overlooks basic human needs. Many find themselves trapped in isolation, building false fortresses with consumption, success, and knowledge to cover up their inner emptiness. This cultural conflict revealed a profound contradiction to me: the reliance and care in Eastern culture provided me with emotional security, while the independence and freedom in Western culture fueled my personal growth. Navigating between the two, I experienced both the empowerment of Western freedom and the realization that excessive independence can erode our capacity for connection and humility. Despite Western society's material wealth, it often feels emotionally impoverished, with many struggling in loneliness. This cultural divide not only led me to question the limitations of individualism but also deepened my appreciation for the deeper connections and emotional dependence found in Eastern culture.</p>
  <p>从最初对“如何改变世界”的好奇，到哥大求学时相信自己能够通过政策改变游戏规则，再到如今对改变世界的审慎态度，这段成长让我深刻认识到理想与现实的鸿沟。目睹过精英们在权力和资本的游戏中操纵他人的命运，我才意识到，这个世界远非我想象的美好与公平。无论是工厂的底层，还是精英的殿堂，个人命运似乎都难以真正掌控。在这个过程中，我逐渐领悟到，真正的改变并不在于宏大的理想或对他人的改造，而在于对自我和周遭细微处的改善。改变世界的幻想，最终被对现实的清醒理解所取代。我认识到，虽然个人的力量有限，但我们可以通过承担责任和关怀他人，改变那些我们能够触及的部分。</p>
  <p>From my initial curiosity about "how to change the world," to my belief during my time at Columbia that I could alter the game through policy, and finally to my more cautious attitude towards changing the world today, this journey has led me to a deep understanding of the gap between ideals and reality. Having witnessed elites manipulate the fate of others through power and capital, I came to realize that the world is far from the fairness and beauty I once imagined. Whether at the bottom of the factory or in the halls of the elite, individual destiny seems difficult to fully control. Throughout this process, I gradually learned that real change does not come from grand ideals or transforming others, but from improving oneself and the surroundings around us. The illusion of changing the world was ultimately replaced by a clear understanding of reality. While individual power is limited, we can still make a difference in the parts of life we can touch by taking responsibility and caring for others.</p>
  <p>总结我的成长经历，每一段痛苦和挣扎，其实都是社会更大矛盾的缩影。无论是家庭的缺失、阶层的无力，还是东西方文化的冲突，这些外在的张力不断塑造着我。我一直试图在个人与社会的碰撞中寻找平衡，慢慢意识到，真正的力量并不在于追求外在的成功或权力的象征，而在于内心的信念与对爱的追求。面对世界的矛盾和不公，我学会了通过内心的成长找到自己的位置与力量。尽管世界充满冲突和挑战，个人仍然有能力在微小的范围内做出改变，创造属于自己的平衡与幸福。这是我面对复杂世界后最大的领悟：真正的力量来自内心的宁静与对生命本质的深刻理解，同时也源于在外部世界中勇敢承担责任、影响他人。内在的平和让我在面对挑战时保持坚韧与清醒，而外部的行动则让我能够以实际的方式改变我所能触及的世界。内外的追求并非对立，而是共同构筑了生命的完整。唯有在认识自我、接受内心需求的同时，积极回应外界的挑战与机会，才能找到真正的平衡与力量，从而在复杂的世界中立足，并赋予生活以更深的意义。</p>  
  <p>Reflecting on my journey, each moment of pain and struggle is, in fact, a reflection of the broader conflicts in society. Whether it was the absence of familial love, the helplessness of class immobility, or the cultural clash between East and West, these external tensions have continuously shaped me. I’ve long sought balance between my personal experiences and the greater societal forces, gradually realizing that true strength doesn’t come from pursuing external success or symbols of power, but from inner belief and the pursuit of love. In facing the world’s contradictions and injustices, I’ve learned to find my place and power through internal growth. Despite the world’s conflicts and challenges, individuals still have the capacity to make small but meaningful changes, creating their own balance and happiness. This is the greatest realization I’ve come to after facing the complexities of the world: true power comes from a deep understanding of life’s essence and the peace within, but also from courageously taking responsibility in the external world and impacting those around us. Inner peace allows us to stay resilient and clear-headed when facing challenges, while external action enables us to create tangible changes in the world we can touch. The pursuit of inner and outer growth is not contradictory; together, they build a complete life. Only by understanding ourselves and accepting our inner needs, while actively responding to external challenges and opportunities, can we find true balance and strength, giving life a deeper sense of meaning in an ever-complex world.</p>
