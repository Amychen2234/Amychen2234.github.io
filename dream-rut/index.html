<p>I began reading "Dream Rut" during a period of severe burnout at work. Yumiko, my graduate school professor at Columbia University, authored the book. I was deeply moved to tears by every word she wrote as they perfectly mirrowed my feelings, struggles, and the realization that I needed a change in my life. A video call with Professor Yumi further prompted me to reflect on what truly mattered to me – regardless of whether they are aligned with societal expectation or not.</p>      
<p>Originally coming to the US for public policy studies to tackle development challenges in underserved communities, I found myself ironically helping the rich richer. A year later, I eventually made the decision to leave that job and now find myself living out the principles outlined in the book. "You may discover that excitement lies in the smallest of things." "Vulnerability illuminates the path forward." The book accurately portrayed how I, or many others who left the ivory tower for a few years, had become disconnected from ourselves and others, growing cold and seeing my circle of relationships shrink. In a "dream rut," excitement left our voice, we grew quieter, and we concealed my dreams that once brought us joy. </p>
<p>The book arrived at the perfect moment, seeking to uplift both us and our dreams. I found myself trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, pushing away nearly everyone, even those I love. My world descended into chaos, filled with noise that drowned out my own voice. It may sound cliché, but we all need that naive and spiritual energy that once seemed irrational to me — the ability to love. This means truly connecting with ourselves, recognizing who we really are, and allowing ourselves, as well as our loved ones, to make mistakes without self-punishment.</p>
