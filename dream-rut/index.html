<p>I began reading Dream Rut during a period of severe burnout at work, and I resonated deeply with the book, authored by Yumiko, my graduate school professor at Columbia University. Every word mirrored my feelings, struggles, and the realization that I was stuck in a "dream rut." A video call with Professor Yumi further encouraged me to reflect on what truly mattered to me. Looking back, I realize that my "dream rut" was rooted in an environment where my sense of self shrank, and I lost sight of where I was heading.</p>
<p>Having a calm and collected mind brings a sense of stability and peace amid life's uncertainties, yet embracing change is what truly liberates our minds. Originally, I came to the US to study public policy, driven by a desire to tackle development challenges in underserved communities. However, I later found myself in a role that contributed to making the rich even richer and helped gain financial security for myself and family. While I genuinely feel fulfilled when helping others, I also find satisfaction in solving investment-related problems, though the latter requires me to keep my emotions in check. This duality reflects the ongoing challenge of balancing my aspirations of doing something good with the realities I encounter of navigating a financial system.</p>
<p>Looking back after almost a year, I eventually made the decision to leave that finance job. Instead of chasing grand goals or ideas, I am now heavily invested in my self-growth through building habits, changing my mindset, and nurturing relationships with others. "You may discover that excitement lies in the smallest of things." "Vulnerability illuminates the path forward." While these sentences may sound spiritual, I found enormous power in them to liberate our potential to find opportunities to learn and contribute. We all need to find inner strength and power to efficiently engage with society eventually and every role matters. To me, I want to develop great qualities at my early 20s and 30s vs achieve enormous success, and find fulfilment in a world full of chaos.</p>
<p>The book arrived at just the right moment, aiming to elevate ourselves and our dreams. I found myself being trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, pushing away nearly everyone, including those I love for a long time. My world descended into chaos, filled with noise that drowned out my own voice. Now, I am witnessing myself climbing out of this trap, despite repeatedly falling back in. I can imagine my future self will appreciate the dark times for the time being, for they make the bright moments that follow even more meaningful.</p>
