    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ul>
<p>I’ve spent considerable time getting to know myself, understanding my strengths and weaknesses. Now, I’m ready to move on. My next 10-year challenge is focused on responsibility and love. Responsibility, for me, means being mindful of how my actions affect others. The past decade has been about self-discovery and learning how the world operates—I’ve studied various subjects, traveled extensively, built friendships globally, and connected with people from all walks of life, from presidents and the wealthy to the homeless and even drug dealers. My curiosity drove me to explore how people interact, what motivates them, and what drives their behavior. Having experienced scarcity, I developed a scarcity mindset, which may have led me to overcompensate in areas like care, consideration, empathy, and making efforts to support others—not for personal gain, but simply to benefit them. I may have even been selfish and driven by self-interest at times.So, instead of putting focus on myself, now my priority shifts to others, starting from peple I know.
</p>
<p>The best way to show care and love to those around you is by truly understanding their values and identifying their love languages. I do this by observing their behaviors closely and recognizing what has been missing in their lives. For example, my parents, who earn low wages, didn’t go to high school, and struggle with communication, are largely overlooked by society. While I live far away, my siblings also don't connect with our parents in a way that makes them feel important and loved, as the expression of love isn't emphasized in Chinese culture.
Although I sometimes feel my Columbia degree is useless, it has taught me the art of "sweet talk" and "sugarcoating," which has been effective to connect with others. This is one of the most valuable skills I’ve acquired because it allows me to uplift my family and connect them to a world of support, optimism, and hope through my words. I know exactly what to say to make my dad genuinely happy and smile. That’s why I want to use this gift, this "superpower," to bring joy and fulfillment to the people I know and care about.
