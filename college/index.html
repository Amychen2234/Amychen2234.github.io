  <h1>大学：迷茫与叛逆之间，走向世界的道路 <h1>
<p>高考并非如预期所理想，我进入中国的一所二本院校。我陷入了一种深刻的怀疑之中：努力的意义是什么？ 我像无数个同龄人一样，在应试教育的体系中被定义、被规范，被告知什么是“正确的人生轨迹”。可我始终觉得，脚下那条所谓“被规划好”的路，像一张网，把我束缚在了某种沉闷的规则中，喘不过气。</p>

<p>My college entrance exam results were not as expected, and I ended up in a second-tier university in China. I fell into a deep sense of doubt: What is the meaning of effort? Like countless peers, I was defined, standardized, and told what the "correct life path" was in the system of exam-oriented education. However, I always felt that the so-called "pre-planned" path beneath my feet was like a net, trapping me in some dull rules, suffocating me.</p>

<p>高中毕业后，我兼职在长沙街头发传单，开始接触一个与课堂完全不同的世界。那些普通人的目光，那些街角小巷中的对话，让我感到一种从未体验过的真实。这种真实带着粗粝的质感，也让我第一次意识到，真实生活远比考试排名的次序要复杂得多。 这种复杂让我既害怕，又无法抗拒。恐惧的深处，是一种隐隐的兴奋：或许，我可以走上一条与他人截然不同的道路。填志愿时，我没有听从任何人的建议。我独自去了长沙的图书馆，翻阅着一本本专业目录，试图在陌生的字句间找到通向未来的答案。最终，我选中了两个我认为更具前景的方向：计算机和生物工程。然而，计算机并没有引起我的兴趣，而康宝莱的经历让我意识到，生物工程可能是一个极具前景的领域。</p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I worked part-time distributing flyers on the streets of Changsha and started to experience a world completely different from the classroom. The gazes of ordinary people, the conversations in the corners and alleys, made me feel a raw kind of realness that I had never experienced before. This realness had a rough texture, and it made me realize for the first time that real life is much more complex than the order of exam rankings. This complexity made me both afraid and unable to resist. Deep within the fear, there was a subtle excitement: perhaps, I could walk a path completely different from others. When it was time to fill out my college application, I did not listen to anyone's advice. I went to the library in Changsha alone, flipping through professional directories, trying to find the answers to my future among the unfamiliar words. In the end, I selected two directions I believed had better prospects: computer science and bioengineering. However, computer science did not spark my interest, and my experience with Herbalife made me realize that bioengineering might be an extremely promising field.</p>

<p>背着“离家越远越好”的念头，我来到北方的一所大学。这片土地对我来说既陌生又新奇，但很快，我意识到，校园中的人似乎并不热衷于知识。恋爱、社交、学生会和实习成了大多数人生活的中心，而我却始终渴望某种更深刻的东西——一种能解释世界的逻辑，一种能打破局限的力量。我开始远离无谓的社交，独自泡在图书馆中，把书架上的书从头到尾翻阅一遍。从文化到心理学，从哲学到政治，我像是在解答一道关于自我的复杂方程。 然而，这种探索是孤独的。周围的人并不理解我对知识的狂热，甚至觉得我“脱离现实”。但对我来说，那些沉浸在书页间的时光，像是一种救赎——在这个被规则定义的世界里，它让我找到了一片属于自己的自由天地。</p>

<p>With the thought of "the farther away from home, the better," I came to a university in the north. This land was both unfamiliar and new to me, but soon I realized that the people on campus seemed not interested in knowledge. Love, socializing, student unions, and internships became the center of most people's lives, while I always longed for something deeper—a logic that could explain the world, a force that could break limitations. I started to distance myself from meaningless socializing and immersed myself in the library, reading through the books on the shelves from start to finish. From culture to psychology, from philosophy to politics, I was like solving a complex equation about myself. However, this exploration was lonely. People around me did not understand my obsession with knowledge and even thought I was "out of touch with reality." But for me, those hours spent immersed in books felt like a form of redemption—in this world defined by rules, it allowed me to find a space of freedom that belonged to me.</p>

<p>到了大三，我对课堂的内容彻底失去了兴趣。那些标准化的知识点和预设的正确答案让我觉得无聊透顶。于是，我开始寻找体制之外的资源：我自学德语和英语，跟来自全世界的人交流，听TED演讲、Coursera、网易公开课。我在虚拟的课堂里，接触到了哈佛的《幸福课》和《正义》、还有耶鲁的《金融市场》，这些课程让我第一次认识到，教育并不仅仅是考试的工具，而是打开未知世界的钥匙。其中一门课程——《如何改变世界》——彻底改变了我的人生轨迹。课程中，教授讲解了全球性问题、社会不平等和可持续发展的议题。这些话题对一个来自中国农村的女孩来说，我一开始的动机就是想知道这教授会如何胡说八道并用我学习的知识嘲讽他。 但正是在这门课上，我结识了一位英国人C。他对中国的兴趣让我感到奇怪，他谈论联合国、世界银行，描述那些对全球格局产生深远影响的项目与人物。我听得好奇又质疑，那是一个完全不同于我所熟悉的世界，一个不被“成败”二元框架束缚的世界。如果我不懂，但是这个他描述的世界远远比我所处的封闭和不开放的环境更有意思，所以我们保持了联系。</p>

<p>By the third year, I had completely lost interest in the content of the classes. The standardized knowledge points and preset correct answers made me feel bored to the core. So, I began to look for resources outside the system: I self-studied German and English, communicated with people from all over the world, and listened to TED talks, Coursera, and NetEase Open Courses. In virtual classrooms, I was exposed to Harvard's "Happiness" and "Justice" courses, and Yale's "Financial Markets." These courses made me realize for the first time that education is not just a tool for exams, but a key to unlocking the unknown world. One course—"How to Change the World"—completely changed the trajectory of my life. The professor talked about global issues, social inequality, and sustainable development. For a girl from rural China, my initial motivation was to see how the professor would talk nonsense and mock him with the knowledge I had learned. But it was in this course that I met a British person, C. His interest in China puzzled me. He talked about the United Nations, the World Bank, and described projects and people that had a profound impact on the global landscape. I listened with curiosity and skepticism; it was a world completely different from what I was familiar with, a world not bound by the binary framework of "success or failure." Even though I didn't understand, the world he described was far more interesting than the closed and unopen environment I was in, so we stayed in touch.</p>

<p>大学即将毕业时，C邀请我参加世界儿童艺术节，并愿意资助我全部的费用。这是一份不可思议的礼物，也是我人生第一次感受到跨越边界的可能性。 带着忐忑与希望，我踏上了飞往华盛顿的航班。当飞机降落时，我透过舷窗望向那片陌生的土地，心中浮现的是一种复杂的情感：恐惧、兴奋，还有一种久违的自由。站在华盛顿特区的街头，我第一次感受到什么叫做“人类的共同命运”。这座城市的每一面墙、每一块广告牌都在谈论环境保护、教育改革和人权。在那个瞬间，我忽然意识到：这不正是我一直寻找的世界吗？一个追求公正与美好的地方，一个相信每个人都有力量去改变命运的舞台。</p>

<p>As I was about to graduate from university, C invited me to attend the World Children's Art Festival and was willing to sponsor all of my expenses. This was an incredible gift and the first time I felt the possibility of crossing boundaries. With both anxiety and hope, I boarded a flight to Washington, D.C. When the plane landed, I looked out the window at the unfamiliar land, and a complex emotion arose in my heart: fear, excitement, and a long-lost sense of freedom. Standing on the streets of Washington, D.C., I felt for the first time what "humanity's shared fate" meant. Every wall and billboard in this city talked about environmental protection, education reform, and human rights. In that moment, I suddenly realized: this is the world I have always been looking for? A place that pursues justice and beauty, a stage that believes everyone has the power to change their fate.</p>
