      <h2>Introduction: Inside the minds of the greatest investors</h2>
      <ul> 
      <p> These questions lie at the heart of this book: What processes, principles, insights, habits, and personality traits could enable the tiny minority to beat the markets in the long run？And how can you and I profit by studying these financial outliers and reverse engineering their winning ways?</p>
      <p> Ruane's philosophy：
      <P> 1）Don't borrow money to buy stocks - you don't act rationally when you use borrowed money </p> 
      <p> 2)  Watch out for momentum </p>
      <p> 3)  Ignore market predictions - the important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that is cheap.</p>
      <p> 4)  Invest in a small amount of stocks that you researched intensively, where you have informational advantage - the most important one. </p>
      <p> Investing is a constant process of calculating the odds. It is all about probabilities, and there is no certainty. The greatest investors are intellectual mavericks - they are not afraid to question and defy conventional wisdom. They profit from the misperceptions and mistakes of people who think less rationally, rigorously, and objectively. The best investors tend to be open-minded pragmatists who search relentlessly for ways to improve their thinking.</p>
      <p> Unless you have a rational reason to believe you have an edge, then you probably don't.</p>
      <P>Playing the odds is an extraordinarily effective way to operate, and it pervades
everything they do, including how they manage their time, how they construct a calm
environment in which to think, whom they hang out with and steer clear of, how
they guard against biases and blind spots, how they learn from mistakes and avoid
repeating them, how they handle stress and adversity, how they think about honesty
and integrity, how they spend money and give it away, and how they attempt to build
lives imbued with a meaning that transcends money.</P>
        <p>Takeaway: I resonate with the author that I have also dimissed Wall Street as a casino full of speculators who only cared about money. When I initially came to the US, I asipired to become someone who could help to make the world a better place - only to realize that I romanticize this goal later on. Investing becomes intriguing to me due to my unconstrained willingness to explore what works in the pursuit of success, not only in markets but also in every area of life. When Thorp was asked how to maximize odds of a happy and successful life, he emphasised on health and fitness. He started running at the age of 30 one mile every Saturday, improving gradually until he completed 21 maratons - this is exactly what I have been trying to do for the same rationale. </p>
        </ul>
      
       <h2>Chapter 1: the man who cloned Warren Buffett</h2>
     <p>Mohnish Pabrai was born in a modest family in India and was not exposed to finance or Wall Street while in India. His family was full of colorful characters - he witnessed his parents lost everything, without money to buy groceries or pay the rent. But his father has the optimism to start a business from 0. As a child, Pabrai suffered from low self-esteem due to poor performance in academics, yet his IQ was 180. It was a big turning point. He headed to Clemson University after high school, where his professor discovered his talent in investing. He completely ignored his professor's advice in majoring in finance and chose computer engineer instead. After college, Pabrai launched a tech consulting company with credit card debt and his 401k - he always had a gambling streak. His consulting company thrived where he set aside $1 million in savings by 1994. That year, he bought a book One Up on Wall Street, where he first read about Buffett and was astonished by his investment returns. This set Pabrai thinking - what if he could figure out how Buffett picked stocks and could mimic his winning approach? Thus began what pabrai describes as a 30-year game to turn his $1m into $1b. His driver is to win the game.Pabrai's approach was not to reinvent the wheel but identified the most skillful player and analyzed why he was so successful, then copied his approach with scrupulous attention to detail. Pabrai's term for this process is cloning - or modeling, mimicry, or replication.Yet Pabrai’s success both as an investor and a philanthropist is built entirely on
smart ideas that he has borrowed from others. “I’m a shameless copycat,” he says.
“Everything in my life is cloned.… I have no original ideas.” Consciously,
systematically, and with irrepressible delight, he has mined the minds of Buffett,
Munger, and others not only for investment wisdom but for insights on how to
manage his business, avoid mistakes, build his brand, give away money, approach
relationships, structure his time, and constructa happy life.
</p>
<p>The laws of investing: Pabrai was convinced that Buffett had laid out "the laws of investing", which are as fundamental as the laws of physics - simple and powerful. He found other fund managers perplexed and none lived by Buffett's laws. Most fund managers owned too many stocks, paid too much, and traded too often. Buffett’s approach to stock picking grew out of three core
concepts that he’d learned from Benjamin Graham, the patron saint of value
investing, who taught Buffett at Columbia and later hired him. First, whenever you
buy a stock, you’re purchasing a portion of an ongoing business with an underlying
value, not justa piece of paper for speculators to trade. Second, Graham viewed the market as a “voting machine,” not a “weighing
machine,” which means that stock prices frequently fail to reflect the true value of
these businesses. As Graham wrote in The Intelligent Investor, the market as a manic-depressive who “often lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him.” Third, you should buy a stock only when it’s selling for much less than your
conservative estimate of its worth. The gap between a company’s intrinsic value and
its stock price provides what Graham called a “margin of safety.”For master
investors such as Buffett and Munger, the essence of the game is to detach themselves
from the madness and watch dispassionately until the bipolar market provides them
with what Munger calls “a mispriced gamble.” There are no prizes for frenetic
activity. Rather, investing is mostly a matter of waiting for these rare
moments when the odds of making money vastly outweigh the odds of losing
it.</p>
<p>Say No to Almost Everything: Following Buffett’s lead, Pabrai constructed an unusually concentrated portfolio.
He figured that ten stocks would give him all the diversification he needed. When
you’re buying so few stocks, you can afford to be choosy. Pabrai glances at hundreds
of stocks and rapidly rejects almost all of them, often in less than a minute. Buffett has said,
“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really
successful people say no to almost everything.”
    Buffett provided Pabrai with several simple filters that helped him to streamline
the sifting. First, says Pabrai, one of Buffett’s “core commandments” is that you can
invest in a company only if it falls within your “circle of competence.” When Pabrai
analyzes a company, he starts by asking, “Is this something I truly understand?” He
pushes himself to consider whether he’s at the center of his circle of competence,
approaching its edge, or outside it. Second, the company has to trade at a large enough discount to its underlying
value to provide a significant margin of safety. Pabrai doesn’t bother to construct
elaborate Excel spreadsheets that might give him an illusion that he can precisely
predict the future. He wants an investment that’s so cheap that it’s a “no-brainer.”
That usually means paying less than fifty cents for $1 worth of assets. “I have very
simple criteria: if something is not going to be an obvious double in a short period of
time—you know, two or three years—I have no interest.” Third, under Munger’s influence, Buffett gradually shifted away from stocks that
were merely cheap toward an emphasis on buying better businesses. Among other
things, this meant that a company should have a durable competitive advantage and
should be run by an honest, capable CEO. Munger pointed out to Pabrai that
Graham, who was fixated on buying stocks that were quantitatively cheap, scored his
best returns by owning GEICO. “It didn’t make him money because it was cheap,”
says Pabrai. “It made him money because it was a great business.” Fourth, the company’s financial statements should be clear and simple. As Buffett
observed, “The only reason that one may not understand a financial statement is
because the writer does not want you to understand it.” If it isn’t easy to figure out
how the business generates cash today and roughly how much it’s likely to generate in
the years to come, Buffett relegates it to what he calls the “too hard” pile. Pabrai once
took a photograph of a box on Buffett’s desk that is literally labeled TOO HARD—a
visual reminder to resist the lure of complexity. Enron and Valeant Pharmaceuticals,
both of which blew up, were easy for Pabrai to reject on that basis alone. His
competitive advantage lies in the fact that he doesn’t care whether you or I think he’s
derivative. All he cares about is what works. “They’re not as shameless as me. They have more ego. To be
a great cloner, you have to check your ego at the door.”
    Be patient and selective, saying no to almost everything. Exploit
the market’s bipolar mood swings. Buy stocks at a big discount to their underlying value.
Stay within your circle of competence. Avoid anything too hard. Make a small number
of mispriced bets with minimal downside and significant upside.
    Most people dabble half-heartedly when they find an idea that works.

 <h2>Chapter 2: the willingness to be lonely</h2>
    <p>Templeton, George Soros, and Warren Buffet shared one invaluable characteristic: the willingness to be lonely, the willingness  d follow their own peculiar path. A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can't be overly influenced by what other people think.</p>

<p>The making of a maverick:Templeton thinks it's far more important to be useful and never thought it is wise to pursue pleasure. It is the greatest gift to have to rely on yourself.</p>
<p>The Bet of a Century:when the world is teetering over the edge of the abyss, how should a savvy investor respond? Despite Templeton's inexperience, he understood enough about economic history, financial markets, and human nature to recognize that overwhelming pessimim would eventually give way to unbridled optimism. Even in the darkest of times, he never forgot that the sun also rises. He had an unemotional appreciation for a mispriced bet that offered an asymmetry between risk and reward.</p>
<p>Six guiding principles for the nontribal investor:1) First of all, said Templeton, beware of emotion: “Most people get led
astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively
careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively
pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses.” 2)Second, said Templeton, beware of your own ignorance, which is
“probably an even bigger problem than emotion.… So many people buy
something with the tiniest amount of information. They don’t really understand what it is that they're buying. 3) Third, said Templeton, you should diversify broadly to protect yourself
from your own fallibility. The moral? Get your ego—and your risk exposure—under control. Templeton
recommended that the average investor should own a minimum of five mutual funds,
each focused on a different area of the financial markets. It’s helpful to study a fund
manager’s long-term record, he added, but this is hardly a guarantee of continued
success. 4) Fourth, said Templeton, successful investing requires patience. 5) Fifth, said Templeton, the best way to find bargains is to study whichever
assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess
whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent. 6) Sixth, said Templeton, “One of the most important things as an investor is
not to chase fads.” The best way for an investor to
avoid popular delusions is to focus not on outlook but on value.</p>
<p>Master of his domain:Given Templeton's compulsive cheapness, it is no surprise that he specialized in buying undervalued stocks.He also sought to eradicate any "aimless, undisciplined thinking" that failed to serve the high aims of his life. As Templeton put it, we have immmense power to shape our lives by choosing where we wish to place our focus, for what we focus on expands. His habits of positive thinking and prayer must have helped enormously in his battle to gain control over his thoughts and emotions. For an investor who specialized in taking unpopular positions, that mental strength was a powerful advantage.</p>



  <h2>Chapter 3: Everything changes: how can we make smart decisions when nothing stays the same and the future is unknowable? Ask Howard Marks.</h2>     
<p>The ancient idea of the Zen concept of mujo, or impermanence has shaped his philosophy of investing and life. Most people make their investment decisions (and life decisions) on the basis of an
unreliable hodgepodge of half-baked logic, biases, hunches, emotion, and vague fantasies or fears about the future. I’ve moved countries several times without truly thinking it through, largely driven by whims or frustration.</p>
<p>Marks is an original thinker - a man captivated by subjects such as risk, randomness, cyclicality, the psychology of investing, and the threat of what he calls "improbable disasters".</p>
    <h2>First, Be Lucky. Second, Be HUmble</h2>
        <p>In a world where nothing is stable or dependable and almost anything can happen, the first rule of the road is to be honest with ourselves about our limitations and vulnerabilities. At the end of the day, the world will see if he is as smart as he thought he was. Marks keeps his own ego in check by reminding himself of the starring role that luck played in life. People who don't fully acknowledge their luck miss the fact that being intelligent is nothing but luck. No one does anything to deserve a high IQ. Life-changing lessons from academic debates: if he wanted to add value as an investor, he should avoid the most efficient markets and focus exclusively on less efficient ones. The more a market is studied and followed and embraced and popularized, the less there should be bargains around for the asking. Investing in inefficient markets is like playing poker only against weak and error-prone opponents. You can stumble into an opportunity that happens to suit your talents and temperament. When there is a really powerful bias against an asset class (high yield bond), there is a way to get a bargin.Any asset, however ugly, can be worth buying if the price is low enough. Indeed, Marks belives that buying cheap is the single most reliable route to investment riches - and that overpaying is the greatest risk. Thus, the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be is it cheap. Everything that is important in investing is counterintuitive, and everything that is obvious is wrong. Marks' humility boosts his immunity against overconfidence, which is a persistent threat to the smartest/luckiest investors.   </p>
<h2>Know What You Don't Know</h2>
<p>The future is influenced by an almost infinite number of factors, and so much randomness is involved that it is impossible to predict future events with any consistency.Any investors who hope to achieve enduring success should internalize this fundamental idea of buying assets below their value. When analyzing any assets, what Marks wants to know, above all, is the amount of optimism that is in the price.  </p>
<h2>Find Order Within Chaos</h2>
<p>Future may be unpredictable, but the recurring process of boom and bust is remarkably predictable. Once we recognize the underlying pattern, we are no longer flying blind. Behavior economists use the term recency bias to describe the cognitive glitch that leads us to overweight the importance of our recent experiences. Human mind also has a treacherous tendency to suppress painful memories.Life-enhancing ability to forget unpleasant experiences is less helpful because woes and mishaps of the past tend to provide the most valuable lesons. Times of laxness have always been followed eventually by corrections in which penalties are imposed - one way Marks gauges the current investment environment is by gathering vignettes about stupid deals getting done. The symptonsof stupidity, overconfidence, greed, and low standards were particularly glaring in the run-up to global financial crisis. There is profound wisdom in the approach of seeing reality as it is, accepting it and adapting to it. As Marks often says, the environment is what it is. We cannot demand a more favorable set of market conditions. But we can control our response, returning more defensive or aggressive depending on the climate. Investors often land themselves in trouble when there is a disconnect between their environment and their behavior - when they ignore or reject reality. </p>
<h2>Most of the Time, the End of the World Doesn't Happen</h2>
<p>Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on. Marks begame to amass an emmense hoard of busted assets when Lehman crushed - the bet of his career, the making or unmaking of his reputation. No choice but to assume this is not the end, but just another cycle to take advantage of. Marks thinks of the future as a distribution of different possibilities - assign probabilities to each of these alternative futures. "What if it is worse than that?" - skepticism when optimism was so abundant but pessimism reached dire levels - not permenently pessimistic. Skepticism calls for pessimism when optimism is excessive, but it also calls for optimism when pessimism is excessive.Five critical ideas: 1) the importance of admitting that we cannot predict or control the future 2) the benefits of studying the patterns of the past and use them as a rough guide to what could happen next 3) the inevitability that cycles will reverse and reckless excess will be punished 4) the possibility of turning cyclicality to our advantage by behaving countercyclically 5) the need for humility, skepticism, and prudence in order to achieve long-term financial success in an uncertain world. All five of these ideas have tremendous utility for any investors looking to navigate the unknowable future. We doom ourseleves to suffer - both in investing and life - when we expect or yearn for things to stay the same. The realproblem is this habit of clinging to or relying on what cannot last. Instead of trying to predict the unpredictable, we can focus on building unfragile portfolios and unfragile lives that are unlikely to collapse even in dire condition. Don't let dreams of a bonanza lead you to expose yourself to the possibility of a catastrophe - not trying to maximize is an important component in preparing for what life may throw at you, and that is true in investing and living. So the question is, do you push the limits. Financial independence comes from spending less than you make - not make and have a lot of money. It is vital to be honest with ourselves about how much risk we can handle - not to overwhelm your emotional resilience and you will be forced to do the wrong thing even if nothing else transpires against you. The path to awakening requires us to become mindful of whatever presents itself to us - to observe with detachment as all things (thoughts, feelings, and sensory perceptions) arise and pass away. Everything is ephemeral and train ourselves to stop grasping at what is inherently unstable. You have to break the chain of getting and wanting - an aimless cycle of craving that leads inevitably to suffering. </p>
        
<h2>Chapter 4: The Resiient Investor - How to Build Enduring Wealth and Survive the Wildness that Lies in Wait - Jean-Marie Eveillard.</h2>
<p>Stock-picking game was to trade actively the big stocks in the index - later build on one all-important insight drew from Intelligent Investor. Minimize risks as future is uncertain - easy to miss significance to gloss over its surface without internalizing its far-reaching implications. Family bankrupcy from a prosperous household during childhood explain Graham's fixation on how to achieve resilience in the face of uncertainty. A series of calamities such as world war one, crash of 1929, great depression led him to a disturbing realization - future of security prices is never predictable. He constructed an investment credo that prioritized survival - the motto margin of safety. Gap between price and value provides a cushion to absorb impact of an investor's own miscalculations, worse than average luck, and the unknown conditions of the future. Eveillard routinely owned 100+ stocks - too skeptical about his skills and too worried that it could blow up. By 1989, Japan accounted for 45% of world's stock market cap, more than the US and UK combined. Eveillard exited Japan in 1988 due to valuation hype, and Japan bubble burst in late 1989, when Japanese stocks fell into a decades-long death spiral. Eveillard's rigorous focus on valuation ket his shareholders safe. At its low in 2009, Nikkei 225 index lost 80%+ in 2 decades. Eveillard's trouble began in 1997. He took an extreme position of owning no tech at all during 1997 and 2000 when the ludicrous valuations and the notorious difficulty of predicting tech companies performance. Career risk specter helps to explain why manay funds hug the index, condemning themselves to unexceptional returns but sparing themselves exceptional grief - career jeopardize if they are wrong. As a result, he lagged the market by miles for 3 years - ~40% for Nasdaq gain and ~24% gain for MSCI World Index vs -0.3% for SoGen in 1998 alone. His prudence started to seem like slow professional suicide. His investment style was ill-suited for fast-changing sectors filled with racy companies trading at irrational valuations - not in an irrational market where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and momentum. SoGen sold his fund to a small investment bank - almost comically mistimed that 2 months later, the tech bubble burst. Eveillard's portfolio of bargain-priced stocks performed superblyas rationality reasserted itself. His flagship investment vehicle, First Eagle Global Fund, trounced Nasdaq by 49% in 00', 31% in 01, and 42% in 02.   </p>
<p>The Unkindness of Strangers: Eveillard's story highlights just how difficult it is to build sustainable investment success over decades, given multitude of destablizing forces and unpredictable havards we encounter along the way. He had the emotional fortitude to endure his colleagues' contempt and override his own doubts, discipline to adhere to Graham's principles, and resist the allure of overvalued stocks. Eveillard's travails - fragility comes in many forms (barraged by shareholder pressure, colleagues commericial agenda, and boss losing faith in him ay precisely the wrong moment) - financial resilience must also be multifaceted. Charlie and Buffett operated Berkshi re in a manner not dependng on the kindness of strangers - can comfortably withstand economic discontinuities, including extremes such as extended market closures. Individual investors have one significant advantage: not answerable to trigger-happy shareholders or any other disgruntled crities. Always keep enough cash in reserve so we will never be forced to sell stocks (or any other beleaguered asset in a downturn. We should never borrow to excess because debt erodes our staying power. Avoid the temptation to speculate on hot stocks with supposedly glorious growth prospects but no margin of safety. We should bypass businesses with weak balance sheets or a looming need for external funding, which is liable to disappear in times of distress. </p>
<p>The Long Game: Irving Kahan the living embodiment of financial resilience. What he learned from Graham that helped him to prosper during his 86 years in finance - "investing is about preserving more than anything. That must be your first thought, not looking for large gains. If you achieve only reasonable returns and suffer min losses, you will become a wealthy man and will surpass any gambler friends you may have. This is also a good way to cure your sleeping problems." - One word "safety". The key to making intelligent investment decisions was always to begin by asking how much can I lose. Warning: Do not self-harm. More fun to tell tales of bold bets that earned billions than to drone on about all of the accidents that never happened. What made Eveillard an enduring giant of global investing was that he avoided losses by repeatedly escaping the deadliest dangers in his path. His success was mostly due to what they did not own: Japanese stocks in late 80s and tech stocks in late 90s, financial stocks in 00-08'. Mattew McLenna - successor of Eveillard - was willing to be short social acceptance and stand apart from the herd. It is lonely sometimes if you are not part of the fad of the moment. But his unconventional background helps to explain his readiness to take the road less traveled. His voracious reading led him to the same wary conclusion that Graham and Eveillard reached: the future is so intrinsically uncertain that investors should focus heavily on avoiding permanent losses and building a portfolio that can endure various states of the world. He said we should start by defining our overarching goal, which ought to guide all of our investment choices. He quoted - if one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable. Our goal is not to try to become rich quickly. It is resilient wealth creation - a much wiser goal than trounce the market. 1926-1945, stock market was ferociously volatile whipsawed by world events, leaving a generation of investors with a lingering dread of risk. Large scale terrorism losses (9/11) focus considerable attention on exposure and on preparing for a future that may look nothing lke recent experience. It is vital to recognize that the pricing of risk goes through enormous cycles. You want to be more willing to commit capital to investments when risk is obviously being well priced (08-09) and you want to be more cautious when risk is not being well priced (99 or 07). You want to be structured to participate in the march of mainkind, but to survive the dips along the way. Investors loaded up on whatever has been performing best - but widespread expectations of continued success lead to inflated prices. Areas of high growth ultimately attract fierce competition. If your goal is resilient wealth creation, you can't operate like a heat-seeking missile. The risks are too extreme because most popular assets provide no margin of safety. Chiseling away anything that looks faddish, including countries and sectors that have attracted indiscriminate flows of capital.He would chip away from companies that add fragility to his portfoli: business models vulnerable to technological change, companies with opaque balance sheets, too much leverage, or imprudent mgmt that is too expeditionary. Uncertainty is intrinsic to the system - it is entropy, the second law of thermodynamics. McLenna focuses on negative mission of avoiding fade by identifying persistent businesses that are less vulnerable to complex competitive forces - anti-entropy strategy. Mundane scarcity - beauty lies in mundanity, not glamour. Stocks he buys should be priced for fade - valuation must be low enough to compensate for his assumption that the company is ultimately on a path to irrelevance. He typically seeks to invest at a 30% discount to his estimate of the company's intrinsic value. If the business does not fade but instead continus to grow, then we get the growth for free. Why people make self-destructive decisions - history of the peloponnesian war.  </p>
<p>Life is Not Simple: moments of extreme pain were followed by new beginnings and extremely propitious opportunities. In markets as in life, so much hinges on our ability to survive the dips. What set some unique talent apart over time is that often it was just the people who did not give up, who just keep learning, keep evolving, stuck to it, and were willing to live through adversity. Best investors: not give up and constantly captivated by cracking the code and have the strength to endure the inevitable periods of disappointmemt. Human potential the path is not linear - it is punctured by episodic disruption. So, if you structure your portfolio and your way of thinking to endure these pockets of disruption, you are more likely to be able to benefit from the march of humankind over time than if you depend on it going well. </p>
<p>Five Rules for Resilience: 1) we need to respect uncertainty 2) to achieve resilience, it is imperative to reduce or eliminate debt, avoid leverage, and beware of excessive expenses, all of which can make us dependent on the kindness of strangers. 3) instead of fixating on short-term gains or beating benchmarks, we should place greater emphasis on becoming shock resistant, avoiding ruin, and staying in the game. 4) beware of overconfidence and complacency. 5) as informed realists, we should be keenly aware of our exposure to risk and should always require a margin of safety - we cannot allow our awareness of risk to make us fearful, pessimistic, or paranoid. </p>


<h2>Chapter 5: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</h2>
<p>Greenblatt was free to pursue his curiosity wherever it took him - forged an unpredictable path. Philanthropist - created a network of 45 free and public charter schools that serve 18,000 students across NYC from low-income and minority households. Greenblatt's motivation is primarily by a game player's delight in devising ingenious ways to win. His strong entrepreneurial streak makes him love starting new ventures. Greenblatt is a kind of code breaker who is drawn inexorably to the intellectual challenge of beating the system. The principles underpinning his strategies are surpringsingly simple in 3 decades of decrptying the market and outwit the competition - reducing the complex game to its purest essence. "Figure out what sth is worth and pay a lot less."  </p>
<p>The simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity: financial services industry tend not to favor simplicity, hence the rise of mind-boggling innovations such as collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, and credit default swapes. Jack Bogle observed in a book titled Enough, financial institutions operate by a kind of reverse Occam's razor. They have a large incentive to favor the complex and costly over the simple and cheap, quite the opposite of what most investors need and out to want. It is rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set. Complexity can be particularly seductive rtap for clever people. Business school reward difficult and complex behavior more than simple behavior. But simple behavior is more effective. Buffett's 4 criteria for selecting stocks: 1) business that we can understand 2) with favorable long-term prospects 3) operated by honest and competent people 4) available at a very attractive price. </p>
<p>Will Danoff's Secret Sauce: Stocls follow earnings. With that principle in mind, he searches with relentless drive for best of breed business that he thinks will grow to be bigger in 5 years. Because if a company doubles its earnings per share in the next 5 years, the stock price is also likely to double (more or less). Danoff does not even worry that much about valuation levels, except when they get ridiculous. Sometimes to own a great company, you have got to pay a fair price. This mindset led him to amass enormous, long-held positions in dominant, well-managed businesses. His mantra does not sound particularly profound but Danoff's edge lies partly in his consistent refusal to overcomplicate. Danoff consciously focuses on the questions that matter most, instead of getting tangled up in distracting details. Miller also learned to simplify his investment process - no longer built models but concentrate on 3~4 critical issues that he believes will drive the business. We each need a simple and consistent investment strategy that works well over time - one that we understand and believe in strongly enough that we will adhere to it faithfully through good times and bad. </p>
<p>Efficient Markets, Crazy people, and Dynamite: Graham taught him one life-changing lesson: stocks are ownership shares of business which you are valuing and trying to buy at a discount. The key is to identify situations in which there is a particularly large spread between price and value of the business. That spread gives you a margin of safety. Once you realize that your entire mission is to value businesses and pay much less for them than they are worth, it is incredibly liberating. High-priced peddlers of complexity as hyper-helpers whose advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish. If you have a way to value business that is disciplined and make sense, you shoud be able to take advantage of other people's emotions. Self-delution is a costly habit in extreme sports such as skydiving and stock picking. Greenblatt's faith in his framework - if his students do a decent job of valuing businesses, buy them at a steep discount to their intrinsic value, and wait patiently for the gap to close between teh current price and their appraisal of the value, the market will eventually reward them. The hitch is that you can never tell how long the process of convergence between price and value will take. </p>
<P>Unfair Bets and Ugly Ducklings: he avoided the faceless corporate conventional career and wanted to find an enjoyable way to get paid for smart ideas, rather than punching a clock. In his summer job at Bear Stearns in options trading, he could lock in automatic profits with no risk of loss using put and call options. His investment strategy at Gotham involved making money not from taking risks but from making unfair bets - he only invested when the odds semed to favor him overwhelmingly. Greenblatt's ultraselective strategy meant that he routinely rejected stocks that looked good, not great. Greenblatt kept pushing himself to articulate more clearly what he'd figured out about how to invest. This process was incredible helpful to me in trying to boil down in a very simple way exactly what I had been trying to do. If you want to become a stock market master, stick to buying good companies, ones that have a high return on capital and to buying thoese companies only at bargain prices, at prices that give you a high earnings yield. </P>
<p>Do you believe in magic: self-defeating behaviors highlight oen of the thornist challenges confronting every investors. It is not enough to find a smart strategy that stacks the odds in your favor over the long haul. You also need the discipline and tenacity to apply that strategy consistently, especially when it is most uncomfortable. Stocks are ownership shares of businesses, which must be valued. They should be bought only when they rtade for less than they are worth. In the long run, the market is rational and will reflect the fair value of these business. </p>
<p>Four Simple Lessons: 1) you don't need the optimal strategy. You need a sensible strategy that is good enough to achieve your financial goals. 2) your strategy should be so simple and logical that you understand it, believe in it to your core, and can stick with it even in the difficult times when it no longer seems to work. 3) you need to ask yourself whether you truly have the skills and temperament to beat the market. 4) it is important to remember that you can be a rich and successful investor without attempting to beat the market. </p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Nick & Zak's Excellent Adventure: A radically unconventional investment partnership reveals that the richest rewards goto those who resists the lure of instant gratification</h2>
<p>Robert Pirsig exalts people who care so intensely about the quality of their actions and decisions - a reflection of inner traits such as patience, integrity, rationality, and serenity. (Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance: an inquiry into values). Motorcycle maintenance provides an ideal metaphor for how to live and work in a transcendent way. The person and the machine - they grow toward quality or fall away from quality together. You really want to do everything with quality as that is where the satisfaction and peace is. </p>
<p>A house built on sand: Zak came from a privileged family in Iraq and his family fled to the UK later on. Hi father made money on things he understood (experting machinery to Iraq) and lost it on things he did not understand (stocks - being scammed by salesperson). These memories left Zak with a permanent suspicion of salesperson, get rich quick schenes, and the casino aspect of wall street. His first job was at a large asset mgmt in HK but was laid off due to his boss misconduct. He was then offered a job by his friend at Deutsche Bank as a sell side analyst specializing in Asian stocks. "You must never persuade someone not to do what they want to, even if you think it's wrong. Just let them do it because you will never be thanked." Zak thought that is a terrible way to live. Sleep and Zakaria did not fantasize about appearng as market gurus on CNBC or being fetishized on the cover of Forbes, nor do they desire to buy themselves castles, airplanes, or yachts.Their ambition was simple - generate superb long-term returns. Anyone who wantsto achieve stella returns would do well to study what Sleep and Zak figured about where to focus their attention and what they ignored. The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. For a start, disregard all ephemeral info that distracts investors from what matters. The concept of shelf life became a valuable filter. Not waste mental energy on unknowable. Similarly, they ignored flood of short-term financial data and recommendations gushing out of wall street. One practical way of extricating from the muck was to discard all the sell side research excreted by Wall Street. The single best thing any investors can do is to not have a TV and a Bloomberg terminal in the office - it is tempting to look at stock prices or check the news.It is like checking email obsessively - you get a little dopamine rush but we all know logically and rationally it is utterly nonproductive. The practice of intentional disconnection may seem perverse in a culture that prizes instant access to infinite information. They disavowed the standard game of ceaselessly collecting data and betting on what it might portend for stocks in the near term - want to think in peace and undisturbed by the popular obsession with what Sleep termed wiggled guessing. It requires uncommon conviction to disregard what most of your peers consider significant. They probed for insights with a long shelf life when they analyzed companies and interviewed CEOs. What is the intended destination for this business in 10 or 20 years? What must mgmt be doing today to raise the probaility of arriving at that destination? What could prevent this company from reaching such a favorable destination? Destination analysis. Sleep and Zak focused on the inputs required for a business to fulfill its potential. Is the company strengthening its relationship with customers by providing superior products, low prices, and efficient services? Is the CEO allocating capital in a rational way that will enhance the company's long term value? Is the company underpaying its employees, mistreating its suppliers, violating its customers' trust, or engaging in any other shortsigted behavior that could jeopardize its eventual greatness? You want to look back at 80 and think you treated clients equitably, did your job properly, gave money away properly - not that you had 4 houses and a jet. It came naturally for them to think along unconventional lines because they were two odd duck who landed the investment industry by accident - a failed landscape architect and a frustrated meteorologist. The book Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintanance - reinforced their determination to resist any low-quality behavior that seemed self-serving or deceitful. The very rapid rejection of things made life very straightforward. Their slow, patient, deliverate strategy was so countercultural that it sounds almost quaint - never used leverage, never shorted a stock, never speculated with options or futures, never made macro bet, never traded hyperactively in response to latest news, etc. They played what they viewed as long and simple game - buy a few intensively researched stocks and holding them for years.     </p>
<p>A house built on rock: Nomad was named because they want to roam anywhere in search of value. Not to replicate a particular index but to gun for outstanding absolute returns, unconstrained by reference to what anyone else was doing. 911 attack kept other investors in shock from the gloom but Sleep and Zak invested boldly amid the turmoil, targetting temporarily depressed business that others were too scared to own, since the future seemed so precarious. They wonered what characteristics account for the success of companies with unusually long shelf of lives - one business model may be more powerful than all the rest - scale economics shared. Sleep has the mental agility to skip lightly between different disciplines - from business history to religion, neuroscience to sports and to identify common themes and patterns.Zak tends to probe more deeply. They kept a list of theme on a whiteboard in their office - which business models work best? - nothing matches the might of the scale economices shared model in fostering corporate longevity. Companies such as Dell, SOuthwest Airlines, Walmart, and Tesco all followed a similar path - kept costs low and passed most of their savings back to consumers, which reciprocated by doing more business with them. Henry Ford dropped thr price of Model T car from $850 in 1908 to $300 in 1925 by harnessing the benefits of assembly-line - the culture of such companies is typycally molded by visionary founders, not hired hands. ROse Blumkin at Nebraska Furniture built America's biggest home-furnishings business by faithfully observing three commandments - sell cheap, tell the truth, and don't cheat anybody. Once Sleep and Zakaria understood the magic of this one business model - they make it the overriding focus of their fund and they concentrated instead on a handful of companies that shared their economies of scale with customers.  </p>
<p>Five Lessons with a long shelf life: 1) they provide a compelling example of what it means to pursue quality as a guiding principle in business, investing and life - a moral and intellectual commitment inspired by Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. 2) there is the idea of focusing on whatever has the longest shelf life, while always downplaying the ephemeral. 3) there is the realization that one particular business model - scale economies shared - creates a virtuous cycle that can generate sustainable wealth over long periods. 4) it is unnecessary to behave unethically or unscrupulously to achieve spectacular success, even in a voraciously capitalistic business where self-serving behavior is the norm. 5) in a world that is increasingly geared toward short-termism and instant gratification, a tremendous advantage can be gained by those who move consistently in the opposite direction. In wealthier nations, everything is available on demand. Similarly, in the investment realm, we can dart in and out of the market instantaneously. We all struggle in our own ways to adjust to this technological and social revolution, which is both miraculous and perilous. It is all about deferred gratification. WHen you look at all mistakes you make in private and professional life, it is almost always because you reached for some short-term fix or some short-term high. That is the overwhelming habit of people in the stock market. Unchecked impulses that ruin investors' returns: tendency to trade too frequently; make emotional decisions based on alarming or alarmist news stories; join the herd in charging after the most popular and overpriced assets; dump funds that lagged for a year or two; sell winning stocks prematurely. The ability to resist such urge is one of the big superpowers - you need to give it huge weight when you are weighing what works. It is not enough to grasp the principle of deferring gratifiction intellectually. Sleep and Zak are titans of impulse control and they constructed an internally consistent ecosystem that supported such behavior. Eliminated disruptive influences by shunnings sell-side analysts and financial consultants; detached from all the drama and excitment that they likened themselves to hermits or monks; invest in businesses run by nonconformists who took exceptionally long view. Need to follow examples by systemically resisting the external and internal forces that push us to act impetuously. Costliest mistakes have come whenever grew impatient or envious of other people's returns and strayed off couse by gambling on private companies or individual stocks that help the promise of a racier route to riches. The paradox here is that the slower road almost always proves to be faster in the end. Nobody personifies this slow-motion mindset better than Thomas Russo - call himself a farmer. He plants seeds and then spend all his time cultivating them. All of the businesses he owns share one trait - the capacity to suffer and they invest for the very long haul. We profit in the long run by embracing or enduring sth that seems unappealing in the short run. We are presented over and over with this same choice between present and future, the instant and the deferred. Buddhist phrase to describe the subtle rewards of resisting unhealthy or unskillful behavior: the joy of nonremorse. Rev Yehuda and Rav Philip teach that the only way to achieve enduring happiness, fulfillness, and freedom is to resist negative inclinations.  </p>

<h2>High performance habits: the best investors build an overwhelming competitive advantage by adopting habits whose benefits compound over time</h2>
<p>Tom Gayner: indomitable consistency of his discipline - most people get fired up for a few days then flame out. Gayner keeps plugging away, never perfect, but always directionally correct. The key is that he is radically moderate about everything he does. Resounding victories tend to be the result of small, incremental advances and improvements sustained over long stretches of time.  </p>
<p>The aggregation of marginal gains: he adheres to a stock-picking strategy built on 4 principles that have not changed in 30 years - point him in the right direction and help him to avoid being stupid like guardrails. 1) he seeks profitable business with good returns on capital and not too much leverage 2) mgmt must have equal measures of talent and integrity 3) company should have ample opp to reinvest its profits at handsome rates of return 4) stock must be available to him at a reasonable price. Richest people were those who found something good and held on to it, and the people who seemed the least happy and the most frenzied and the least successful are those that are alwys chasing the next hot thing. Emphasis on disaster avoidance: slow to appreciate the sustainable competitive advantages in tech stocks - not cheap and could not value them precisely; so he took an incremental approach and steadily accumulated big positions, dollar-cost averaging his way in to reduce the risk of overpaying. Not disastrous if he has blundered. Make your mistakes nonfatal - it is so fundamental to longevity. Dependability - do it over and over again, it keeps you in the game. You don't need to be extreme to achieve exceptional long term results. On the contrary, people get themselves into trouble with extremes. His steadyfast pursuit of a radically moderate path would have met with the approval of some of the wisest thinkers in history, such as Confucius, Aristotle, Buddha, and Maimonides. Golden mean - physical pleasures such as food, wine, and sex - stake out a middle ground between overindulgence and abstinence. In face of risk, he recommended steering a judicious course between opposing extremes of timidity and recklessness. For the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything becomes a corward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes rash. His real advantage is behavioral, not intellectual - he compensates for the lack of intellect with more discipline and steadiness and persistence. His satisfying, slow, and steady method of building wealth relies heavily on common sense and well-chosen habits, not esoteri skills or daredevil risks. 1) live on less than you make and invest the difference at a positive rate of return. The aggregation of marginal gains - triumphs stemmed not from one major innovation, but a multitude of minor improvements, which combined to create a crushing advantage. inconsequential—the equivalent of cyclists traveling with their favorite pillows. He
gets up early and arrives at the of ice early. He jogs and does yoga. He eats heaps of salad and a dearth of doughnuts. He works in a quiet of ice where he can focus. He consistently applies four time-tested principles as a filter for every investment idea. He
invests in a tax-ef icient manner. He keeps his investment expenses as low as possible. He lives way below his means. He reads insatiably. He studies and intelligently clones other sophisticated investors. He prays, goes to church, and draws emotional strength from his faith in a higher power. He behaves in ways that inspire trust and goodwill. None of these practices is earth-shattering in isolation. It is the aggregation of marginal gains that is so powerful. The modest benefits generated by smart habits continue to compound over many years. What we need is a selection of sensible habits that are directionally correct and sustainable - habits that give us a marginal advantage that will compound over time.  </p>
<p>Bring the heat: why is Jeff Vinik so successful? Hard work - the more companies you analyze/the more cash-flow statements you can go through- go through every line of/the more good ideas you are going to find, the better the performance is going to be. You can get a sense that there are real people out here trusting you with their hard-earned money. The responsibility combined with guilt and fear, and the desire to set a good example is a powerful motivator. Best investors are mental athlets - they strive constantly for an intellectual advantage, more info, better info, faster info, or simply a more naunced interpretation of info taht is already out there for everyone to see. All that hard-earned knowledge compounds over time and pays off in unpredictable ways. </p>
