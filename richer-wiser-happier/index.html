      <h2>Introduction: Inside the minds of the greatest investors</h2>
      <ul> 
      <li> These questions lie at the heart of this book: What processes, principles, insights, habits, and personality traits could enable the tiny minority to beat the markets in the long run？And how can you and I profit by studying these financial outliers and reverse engineering their winning ways?</li>
      <p> Ruane's philosophy：
      <P> 1） Don't borrow money to buy stocks - you don't act rationally when you use borrowed money </p> 
      <p> 2)  Watch out for momentum </p>
      <p> 3)  Ignore market predictions - the important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that is cheap.</p>
      <p> 4)  Invest in a small amount of stocks that you researched intensively, where you have informational advantage - the most important one. </p>
      <p> Investing is a constant process of calculating the odds. It is all about probabilities, and there is no certainty. The greatest investors are intellectual mavericks - they are not afraid to question and defy conventional wisdom. They profit from the misperceptions and mistakes of people who think less rationally, rigorously, and objectively. The best investors tend to be open-minded pragmatists who search relentlessly for ways to improve their thinking.</p>
      <p> Unless you have a rational reason to believe you have an edge, then you probably don't.</p>
      <P>Playing the odds is an extraordinarily effective way to operate, and it pervades
everything they do, including how they manage their time, how they construct a calm
environment in which to think, whom they hang out with and steer clear of, how
they guard against biases and blind spots, how they learn from mistakes and avoid
repeating them, how they handle stress and adversity, how they think about honesty
and integrity, how they spend money and give it away, and how they attempt to build
lives imbued with a meaning that transcends money.</P>
        <p>Takeaway: I resonate with the author that I have also dimissed Wall Street as a casino full of speculators who only cared about money. When I initially came to the US, I asipired to become someone who could help to make the world a better place - only to realize that I romanticize this goal later on. Investing becomes intriguing to me due to an unconstrained willingness to explore what works to study in the pursuit of success, not only in markets but also in every area of life. When Thorp was asked how to maximize odds of a happy and successful life, he emphasised on health and fitness. He started running at the age of 30 one mile every Saturday, improving gradually until he completed 21 maratons - this is exactly what I have been doing and I am hoping to do a maraton in a year or two. </p>
