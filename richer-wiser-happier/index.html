      <h2>Introduction: Inside the minds of the greatest investors</h2>
      <ul> 
      <p> These questions lie at the heart of this book: What processes, principles, insights, habits, and personality traits could enable the tiny minority to beat the markets in the long run？And how can you and I profit by studying these financial outliers and reverse engineering their winning ways?</p>
      <p> Ruane's philosophy：
      <P> 1）Don't borrow money to buy stocks - you don't act rationally when you use borrowed money </p> 
      <p> 2)  Watch out for momentum </p>
      <p> 3)  Ignore market predictions - the important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that is cheap.</p>
      <p> 4)  Invest in a small amount of stocks that you researched intensively, where you have informational advantage - the most important one. </p>
      <p> Investing is a constant process of calculating the odds. It is all about probabilities, and there is no certainty. The greatest investors are intellectual mavericks - they are not afraid to question and defy conventional wisdom. They profit from the misperceptions and mistakes of people who think less rationally, rigorously, and objectively. The best investors tend to be open-minded pragmatists who search relentlessly for ways to improve their thinking.</p>
      <p> Unless you have a rational reason to believe you have an edge, then you probably don't.</p>
      <P>Playing the odds is an extraordinarily effective way to operate, and it pervades
everything they do, including how they manage their time, how they construct a calm
environment in which to think, whom they hang out with and steer clear of, how
they guard against biases and blind spots, how they learn from mistakes and avoid
repeating them, how they handle stress and adversity, how they think about honesty
and integrity, how they spend money and give it away, and how they attempt to build
lives imbued with a meaning that transcends money.</P>
        <p>Takeaway: I resonate with the author that I have also dimissed Wall Street as a casino full of speculators who only cared about money. When I initially came to the US, I asipired to become someone who could help to make the world a better place - only to realize that I romanticize this goal later on. Investing becomes intriguing to me due to my unconstrained willingness to explore what works in the pursuit of success, not only in markets but also in every area of life. When Thorp was asked how to maximize odds of a happy and successful life, he emphasised on health and fitness. He started running at the age of 30 one mile every Saturday, improving gradually until he completed 21 maratons - this is exactly what I have been trying to do for the same rationale. </p>
        </ul>
      
       <h2>Chapter 1: the man who cloned Warren Buffett</h2>
     <p>Mohnish Pabrai was born in a modest family in India and was not exposed to finance or Wall Street while in India. His family was full of colorful characters - he witnessed his parents lost everything, without money to buy groceries or pay the rent. But his father has the optimism to start a business from 0. As a child, Pabrai suffered from low self-esteem due to poor performance in academics, yet his IQ was 180. It was a big turning point. He headed to Clemson University after high school, where his professor discovered his talent in investing. He completely ignored his professor's advice in majoring in finance and chose computer engineer instead. After college, Pabrai launched a tech consulting company with credit card debt and his 401k - he always had a gambling streak. His consulting company thrived where he set aside $1 million in savings by 1994. That year, he bought a book One Up on Wall Street, where he first read about Buffett and was astonished by his investment returns. This set Pabrai thinking - what if he could figure out how Buffett picked stocks and could mimic his winning approach? Thus began what pabrai describes as a 30-year game to turn his $1m into $1b. His driver is to win the game.Pabrai's approach was not to reinvent the wheel but identified the most skillful player and analyzed why he was so successful, then copied his approach with scrupulous attention to detail. Pabrai's term for this process is cloning - or modeling, mimicry, or replication.Yet Pabrai’s success both as an investor and a philanthropist is built entirely on
smart ideas that he has borrowed from others. “I’m a shameless copycat,” he says.
“Everything in my life is cloned.… I have no original ideas.” Consciously,
systematically, and with irrepressible delight, he has mined the minds of Buffett,
Munger, and others not only for investment wisdom but for insights on how to
manage his business, avoid mistakes, build his brand, give away money, approach
relationships, structure his time, and constructa happy life.
</p>
<p>The laws of investing: Pabrai was convinced that Buffett had laid out "the laws of investing", which are as fundamental as the laws of physics - simple and powerful. He found other fund managers perplexed and none lived by Buffett's laws. Most fund managers owned too many stocks, paid too much, and traded too often. Buffett’s approach to stock picking grew out of three core
concepts that he’d learned from Benjamin Graham, the patron saint of value
investing, who taught Buffett at Columbia and later hired him. First, whenever you
buy a stock, you’re purchasing a portion of an ongoing business with an underlying
value, not justa piece of paper for speculators to trade. Second, Graham viewed the market as a “voting machine,” not a “weighing
machine,” which means that stock prices frequently fail to reflect the true value of
these businesses. As Graham wrote in The Intelligent Investor, the market as a manic-depressive who “often lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him.” Third, you should buy a stock only when it’s selling for much less than your
conservative estimate of its worth. The gap between a company’s intrinsic value and
its stock price provides what Graham called a “margin of safety.”For master
investors such as Buffett and Munger, the essence of the game is to detach themselves
from the madness and watch dispassionately until the bipolar market provides them
with what Munger calls “a mispriced gamble.” There are no prizes for frenetic
activity. Rather, investing is mostly a matter of waiting for these rare
moments when the odds of making money vastly outweigh the odds of losing
it.</p>
<p>Say No to Almost Everything: Following Buffett’s lead, Pabrai constructed an unusually concentrated portfolio.
He figured that ten stocks would give him all the diversification he needed. When
you’re buying so few stocks, you can afford to be choosy. Pabrai glances at hundreds
of stocks and rapidly rejects almost all of them, often in less than a minute. Buffett has said,
“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really
successful people say no to almost everything.”
    Buffett provided Pabrai with several simple filters that helped him to streamline
the sifting. First, says Pabrai, one of Buffett’s “core commandments” is that you can
invest in a company only if it falls within your “circle of competence.” When Pabrai
analyzes a company, he starts by asking, “Is this something I truly understand?” He
pushes himself to consider whether he’s at the center of his circle of competence,
approaching its edge, or outside it. Second, the company has to trade at a large enough discount to its underlying
value to provide a significant margin of safety. Pabrai doesn’t bother to construct
elaborate Excel spreadsheets that might give him an illusion that he can precisely
predict the future. He wants an investment that’s so cheap that it’s a “no-brainer.”
That usually means paying less than fifty cents for $1 worth of assets. “I have very
simple criteria: if something is not going to be an obvious double in a short period of
time—you know, two or three years—I have no interest.” Third, under Munger’s influence, Buffett gradually shifted away from stocks that
were merely cheap toward an emphasis on buying better businesses. Among other
things, this meant that a company should have a durable competitive advantage and
should be run by an honest, capable CEO. Munger pointed out to Pabrai that
Graham, who was fixated on buying stocks that were quantitatively cheap, scored his
best returns by owning GEICO. “It didn’t make him money because it was cheap,”
says Pabrai. “It made him money because it was a great business.” Fourth, the company’s financial statements should be clear and simple. As Buffett
observed, “The only reason that one may not understand a financial statement is
because the writer does not want you to understand it.” If it isn’t easy to figure out
how the business generates cash today and roughly how much it’s likely to generate in
the years to come, Buffett relegates it to what he calls the “too hard” pile. Pabrai once
took a photograph of a box on Buffett’s desk that is literally labeled TOO HARD—a
visual reminder to resist the lure of complexity. Enron and Valeant Pharmaceuticals,
both of which blew up, were easy for Pabrai to reject on that basis alone. His
competitive advantage lies in the fact that he doesn’t care whether you or I think he’s
derivative. All he cares about is what works. “They’re not as shameless as me. They have more ego. To be
a great cloner, you have to check your ego at the door.”
    Be patient and selective, saying no to almost everything. Exploit
the market’s bipolar mood swings. Buy stocks at a big discount to their underlying value.
Stay within your circle of competence. Avoid anything too hard. Make a small number
of mispriced bets with minimal downside and significant upside.
    Most people dabble half-heartedly when they find an idea that works.

 <h2>Chapter 2: the willingness to be lonely</h2>
    <p>Templeton, George Soros, and Warren Buffet shared one invaluable characteristic: the willingness to be lonely, the willingness to take a position that others don't think is too bright.They have an inner conviction
thatalot of people do not have. Best investors are iconoclasts, mavericks, and misfits who see the world differently from the crowd and follow their own peculiar path. A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can't be overly influenced by what other people think.</p>

<p>The making of a maverick:Templeton thinks it's far more important to be useful and never thought it is wise to pursue pleasure. It is the greatest gift to have to rely on yourself.</p>
<p>The Bet of a Century:when the world is teetering over the edge of the abyss, how should a savvy investor respond? Despite Templeton's inexperience, he understood enough about economic history, financial markets, and human nature to recognize that overwhelming pessimim would eventually give way to unbridled optimism. Even in the darkest of times, he never forgot that the sun also rises. He had an unemotional appreciation for a mispriced bet that offered an asymmetry between risk and reward.</p>
<p>Six guiding principles for the nontribal investor:1) First of all, said Templeton, beware of emotion: “Most people get led
astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively
careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively
pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses.” 2)Second, said Templeton, beware of your own ignorance, which is
“probably an even bigger problem than emotion.… So many people buy
something with the tiniest amount of information. They don’t really understand what it is that they're buying. 3) Third, said Templeton, you should diversify broadly to protect yourself
from your own fallibility. The moral? Get your ego—and your risk exposure—under control. Templeton
recommended that the average investor should own a minimum of five mutual funds,
each focused on a different area of the financial markets. It’s helpful to study a fund
manager’s long-term record, he added, but this is hardly a guarantee of continued
success. 4) Fourth, said Templeton, successful investing requires patience. 5) Fifth, said Templeton, the best way to find bargains is to study whichever
assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess
whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent. 6) Sixth, said Templeton, “One of the most important things as an investor is
not to chase fads.” The best way for an investor to
avoid popular delusions is to focus not on outlook but on value.</p>
<p>Master of his domain:Given Templeton's compulsive cheapness, it is no surprise that he specialized in buying undervalued stocks.He also sought to eradicate any "aimless, undisciplined thinking" that failed to serve the high aims of his life. As Templeton put it, we have immmense power to shape our lives by choosing where we wish to place our focus, for what we focus on expands. His habits of positive thinking and prayer must have helped enormously in his battle to gain control over his thoughts and emotions. For an investor who specialized in taking unpopular positions, that mental strength was a powerful advantage.</p>



  <h2>Chapter 3: Everything changes: how can we make smart decisions when nothing stays the same and the future is unknowable? Ask Howard Marks.</h2>     
<p>The ancient idea of the Zen concept of mujo, or impermanence has shaped his philosophy of investing and life. Most people make their investment decisions (and life decisions) on the basis of an
unreliable hodgepodge of half-baked logic, biases, hunches, emotion, and vague fantasies or fears about the future. I’ve moved countries several times without truly thinking it through, largely driven by whims or frustration.</p>
<p>Marks is an original thinker - a man captivated by subjects such as risk, randomness, cyclicality, the psychology of investing, and the threat of what he calls "improbable disasters".</p>
    <h2>First, Be Lucky. Second, Be HUmble</h2>
        <p>In a world where nothing is stable or dependable and almost anything can happen, the first rule of the road is to be honest with ourselves about our limitations and vulnerabilities. At the end of the day, the world will see if he is as smart as he thought he was. Marks keeps his own ego in check by reminding himself of the starring role that luck played in life. People who don't fully acknowledge their luck miss the fact that being intelligent is nothing but luck. No one does anything to deserve a high IQ. Life-changing lessons from academic debates: if he wanted to add value as an investor, he should avoid the most efficient markets and focus exclusively on less efficient ones. The more a market is studied and followed and embraced and popularized, the less there should be bargains around for the asking. Investing in inefficient markets is like playing poker only against weak and error-prone opponents. You can stumble into an opportunity that happens to suit your talents and temperament. When there is a really powerful bias against an asset class (high yield bond), there is a way to get a bargin.Any asset, however ugly, can be worth buying if the price is low enough. Indeed, Marks belives that buying cheap is the single most reliable route to investment riches - and that overpaying is the greatest risk. Thus, the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be is it cheap. Everything that is important in investing is counterintuitive, and everything that is obvious is wrong. Marks' humility boosts his immunity against overconfidence, which is a persistent threat to the smartest/luckiest investors.   </p>
<h2>Know What You Don't Know</h2>
<p>The future is influenced by an almost infinite number of factors, and so much randomness is involved that it is impossible to predict future events with any consistency.Any investors who hope to achieve enduring success should internalize this fundamental idea of buying assets below their value. When analyzing any assets, what Marks wants to know, above all, is the amount of optimism that is in the price.  </p>
<h2>Find Order Within Chaos</h2>
<p>Future may be unpredictable, but the recurring process of boom and bust is remarkably predictable. Once we recognize the underlying pattern, we are no longer flying blind. Behavior economists use the term recency bias to describe the cognitive glitch that leads us to overweight the importance of our recent experiences. Human mind also has a treacherous tendency to suppress painful memories.Life-enhancing ability to forget unpleasant experiences is less helpful because woes and mishaps of the past tend to provide the most valuable lesons. Times of laxness have always been followed eventually by corrections in which penalties are imposed - one way Marks gauges the current investment environment is by gathering vignettes about stupid deals getting done. The symptonsof stupidity, overconfidence, greed, and low standards were particularly glaring in the run-up to global financial crisis. There is profound wisdom in the approach of seeing reality as it is, accepting it and adapting to it. As Marks often says, the environment is what it is. We cannot demand a more favorable set of market conditions. But we can control our response, returning more defensive or aggressive depending on the climate. Investors often land themselves in trouble when there is a disconnect between their environment and their behavior - when they ignore or reject reality. </p>
