   <h2>初中：乡村到小城市的裂痕</h2>

<p>外公外婆的家是我童年的避风港，一个简单却充满温暖的地方。在那里，我的需求得到了满足，感受到无条件的爱。然而，随着他们相继去世，我的生活被迫进入一个全新的阶段：回到父母身边。这不仅是空间上的变化，更是一场情感上的震荡，是我成长道路上的第一道裂痕。在父母家，我很快意识到，这个环境与外公外婆家截然不同。母亲的脾气暴躁且控制欲极强，父亲则沉默寡言，几乎不干涉任何事情。家中的气氛压抑而冷漠，缺乏安全感和情感支持。这样的环境让我迅速明白，我无法依赖他人，必须为自己争取一切。</p>

<p>Grandpa and Grandma's house was my childhood refuge, a simple yet warm place. There, my needs were met, and I felt unconditional love. However, as they passed away one after another, my life was forced into a new phase: returning to my parents. This was not only a spatial change but an emotional shock, marking the first crack in my growth journey. At my parents' house, I quickly realized that this environment was very different from my grandparents'. My mother's temper was volatile and controlling, while my father was taciturn, hardly interfering in anything. The atmosphere at home was oppressive and cold, lacking safety and emotional support. In this environment, I quickly learned that I couldn't rely on my family and had to fight for everything to fulfill my own needs. </p>

<p>起初，我对母亲的批评逆来顺受，甚至努力通过优秀的表现来寻求她的认可。我以优异的成绩赢得老师的表扬，主动承担农活和家务活，想要证明自己是“好女儿”。然而，无论我多么努力，母亲的批评却从未停止。这让我开始怀疑：是否是我不够好？但初中生物课的一堂课改变了我。当老师讲到基因的概念时，我突然领悟到，或许父母对我的期待并不是出于爱，而是因为我承载了他们的基因。这份认知令我震惊，也让我第一次质疑“爱”的本质。</p>

<p>At first, I passively accepted my mother's criticism and even tried to earn her approval through excellent performance. I won praise from my teachers with outstanding grades, voluntarily took on farming and housework, trying to prove that I was a "good daughter". However, no matter how hard I tried, my mother's criticism never stopped. This made me begin to doubt: am I not good enough? But one biology class in junior high school changed me. When the teacher talked about the concept of genes, I suddenly realized that perhaps my parents' expectations were not out of love, but because I carried their genes. This realization shocked me and made me question the essence of "love" for the first time.</p>

<p>这份认知令我震惊，也让我第一次质疑“爱”的本质。这种怀疑埋下了叛逆的种子。我开始不再完全服从母亲的控制，而是尝试以自己的方式表达抗议。最初，我在争吵中抬高音量，后来用课堂上学到的知识反驳她。这些反抗是对自我力量的试探，也是对压迫环境的微弱抵抗。但母亲的行为却愈发极端：她撕毁我的课外书，丢掉我心爱的衣物，甚至在全班同学面前大喊让我退学。这样的羞辱让我既愤怒又绝望，同时催生了一种强烈的愿望：离开这个家，越远越好。我在14岁的时候就在心中决定要从家庭中独立出来远走高飞。</p>

<p>This realization shocked me and made me question the essence of "love" for the first time. This doubt planted the seed of rebellion. I began to no longer fully obey my mother's control, but instead, I tried to express my protest in my own way. At first, I raised my voice in arguments, and later, I used the knowledge I learned in class to contradict her. These acts of rebellion were a trial of my own strength and a faint resistance to the oppressive environment. However, my mother's behavior became more extreme: she tore up my extracurricular books, threw away my beloved clothes, and even shouted in front of the whole class, telling me to drop out. This humiliation made me both angry and desperate, while also giving birth to a strong desire: to leave this house, as far as possible. At the age of 14, I made up my mind to break free from my family and fly away to independence.</p>

<p>相比母亲的严厉与羞辱，父亲的沉默让我感受到一种截然不同的无助。他偶尔表现出的关爱，例如默默递牛奶、送我上学，虽温暖，却如同昙花一现。他从未真正站出来保护我，这种缺席的父爱让我觉得自己被孤立在家庭的争斗之中。这种孤立感，日后也延续到了我的人际关系中，让我对他人的关爱与支持产生深深的怀疑。</p>

<p>Compared to my mother's harshness and humiliation, my father's silence made me feel a completely different kind of helplessness. The occasional care he showed, such as quietly handing me milk or sending me to school, was warm but fleeting. He never truly stood up to protect me, and this absence of paternal love made me feel isolated in the family struggles. This sense of isolation would later continue into my relationships with others, making me deeply suspicious of the care and support of others.</p>

<p>与家庭的压抑形成鲜明对比的是学校带来的短暂喘息。我的成绩始终名列前茅，老师的表扬让我感受到被认可的喜悦。我在学校交到了朋友，甚至得到了一些男生的青睐。但农村的初中环境相对封闭，大家居住得很近，彼此之间的熟悉感掩盖不了贫乏与单调。这种环境让我感到窒息，然而随着互联网的兴起，一扇通往新世界的窗户被打开。QQ、网络游戏以及网吧成为我们那个时代最令人兴奋的活动之一。通过互联网，我第一次接触到乡村以外的世界。这种连接让我蠢蠢欲动，渴望逃离这个闭塞的地方。初三时，我终于找到了机会转学到益阳市的一所重点初中，寄居在亲戚家中。</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to the oppression at home, school provided a brief respite. My grades were consistently at the top, and the praise from my teachers made me feel recognized. I made friends at school, and even received some attention from boys. However, the rural junior high school environment was relatively closed, and despite the familiarity of living close together, it could not hide the poverty and monotony. This environment made me feel suffocated, but with the rise of the internet, a window to a new world was opened. QQ, online games, and internet cafes became some of the most exciting activities for us at that time. Through the internet, I first came into contact with the world outside the village. This connection made me restless, yearning to escape from this enclosed place. In my third year of junior high school, I finally found the opportunity to transfer to a key middle school in Yiyang, where I stayed with relatives.</p>

<p>我寄居的亲戚是村里最受尊敬的知识分子：叔爷爷是大学生，叔奶奶是一名护士。他们为我从乡村转到城市提供了可能。在他们家，我听到了许多关于他们早年文化大革命奋斗与牺牲的故事，接触到了知识分子的视角。他们家的故事和书籍，仿佛为我打开了一扇通往更广阔世界的大门。即使当时住在客厅，没有自己的私人空间，但我非常珍惜与他们共度的时光。</p>

<p>The relatives I stayed with were the most respected intellectuals in my family: Uncle Grandpa was a university graduate, and Aunt Grandma was a nurse. They made it possible for me to move from the countryside to the city. In their home, I heard many stories of their early struggles and sacrifices during cultural revolution, and I was exposed to an intellectual perspective. Their stories and books seemed to open a door for me to a broader world. Although I stayed in the living room at that time, without my own private space, I cherished the time spent with them.</p>

<p>相比乡村学校，城市的教学条件和同学们的家庭背景都丰富得多。然而，这样的环境也让我面临前所未有的身份冲突：我是从乡村来的“外人”。我的口音、穿着和言行总是吸引注意，成为被议论的对象。尽管我成绩优秀，但我仍感受到深深的隔阂。同学们不一定因此接纳我，而我也无法融入他们的圈子。这种生活的孤独感，叠加母亲施加的压力，让我不敢表现出真实的情感。内心的愤怒与挫败被压抑得越来越深，最终埋下了一颗种子：逃离，我想逃去一个让我感觉安定和可以做自己的地方。</p>

<p>Compared to the rural school, the teaching conditions in the city and the family backgrounds of the classmates were much richer. However, this environment also made me face an unprecedented identity conflict: I was an "outsider" from the countryside. My accent, clothing, and behavior always attracted attention and became subjects of gossip. Although I had excellent grades, I still felt a deep sense of alienation. My classmates didn't necessarily accept me because of this, and I couldn't fit into their circles. This sense of loneliness, compounded by the pressure from my mother, made me afraid to show my true feelings. The anger and frustration inside me were suppressed more and more, eventually planting a seed: to escape, I wanted to go to a place where I could feel stable and be myself.</p>

<p>如今回头看，我的初中阶段不仅是个人成长的起点，也是中国社会快速变迁的缩影。在那个城乡差距巨大、城市化加速的时代，我个人的挣扎与这片土地的变化紧密相连。乡村的压抑与单调、城市的陌生与排斥，以及教育的有限性，共同塑造了我的世界观。</p>

<p>Looking back, my junior high school stage was not only the starting point of my personal growth but also a microcosm of China's rapid social changes. In an era of huge urban-rural disparities and accelerated urbanization, my personal struggles were closely linked to the changes of this land. The oppression and monotony of the countryside, the strangeness and rejection of the city, and the limitations of education together shaped my worldview.</p>
